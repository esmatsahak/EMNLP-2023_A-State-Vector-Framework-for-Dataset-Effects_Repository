tr	9	The plush heart bobbed around wildly as he turned the key to Motel Room Number Six .
tr	6	""" Good afternoon , sir , "" she replied in mellifluous English ."

tr	10	He watched as her eyes flashed away from her nails and looked up at him in mild surprise .
tr	11	She said she 'd give them up to the police if anything more happened .
tr	9	All that accomplished was putting a smile on Mr. Belvedere 's face -- fucking masochist .

tr	11	It was time to start courting her .

tr	9	They had to withstand all the elements and pressures atmospheric and space travel would load on them .
tr	10	He charged forward as the shapeshifter climbed back to its feet , its chest caved in .
tr	9	Behind him , Len Doyle sat at the wheel of his skiff , maneuvering across the narrow channel toward their destination .
tr	9	Setting the precious document aside , he picked up the phone to call the company lawyer .
tr	6	He looks so much like his father .
tr	6	Then I tied the dark green ribbon in my hair on the highest braid .
tr	10	I felt my blisters start to disappear .
tr	8	""" I know that our betrothal is not easy ."
tr	7	Annie : dresses like a Sunday evening period drama , lives with her granddad ... and fights like a ninja .
tr	8	She looked across the hostel car park at the residential brick building of Sheringham YHA .
tr	11	Then , reconsidering , he rationalized to himself , ' What would be the harm ? '
tr	10	I was used to being hit on .
tr	8	""" 007 , please locate Dr. Alfred Harland on the receptionist security connection , "" said William ."
tr	7	Chip had a lot of time on his hands these days .
tr	11	She saw me and frantically began struggling in a desperate attempt to free herself .
tr	10	There was simply no way to get them all .
tr	10	""" You would like to kill me , wouldn 't you , sweetheart ? """
tr	8	If anything the numbers were growing at an alarming rate .
tr	7	The one in front threw back her hood , revealing Mana .
tr	8	He just wanted to impress his friends .
tr	6	""" Not only that , "" Jacob said , "" she wasn 't keen on me , either . """
tr	8	We 'd escape into the sunshine , maybe stop at a café and sip a few lattes .

tr	9	""" You were the one who made first contact ."
tr	10	""" Oskar was supposed to bring the news , but he fell from his horse just as he was leaving ."

tr	7	He stroked his chin delicately and finally nodded in approval .
tr	9	"Do you want it ? """
tr	8	Then she was falling , falling in silent , blind terror .
tr	7	""" What would you have me do ? """
tr	7	""" At the end of the Great War they were married ."
tr	7	I stared at the blue eyes so alike to mine .

tr	8	Where the industrial might of civilization had reared so proudly , there was flame .
tr	10	I noticed you couldn 't open the door from the inside .
tr	8	This journey must be made in the light .
tr	8	A group of balding men walked in wearing trench coats .

tr	11	She stood , frozen for a moment , staring at the manure and holding the rope attached to the horse .
tr	8	He had signed them as his last official duty before resigning .
tr	9	The t-shirt he wore under his blazer bore a silhouette of Che Guevara 's face .
tr	8	The Bastian tech 's voice came over the earpiece with a faint buzz of static .
tr	11	Something had to happen to break the deafening silence .
tr	8	Claire , I need to see you .
tr	5	After five endlessly long rings , Shirl Remington 's answering machine clicked on .
tr	7	Elaina sat at the table across from Landon , nursing her lukewarm tea .
tr	8	I gripped the sides of the table and stared him down .
tr	6	The first time , he brought fresh eggs back with him .
tr	6	A puffy white orb was pushed forth -- a blind , third eye opening .
tr	8	CHAPTER TWELVE They needed more bullets .
tr	7	But across the gorge to the east , it was nothing but a sheer mountain cliff .

tr	5	Through the open window , a three-quarter moon was visible .
tr	9	When he turned to her finally , out of breath , his eyes were again that dark ochre colour .
tr	8	His car chimed , jolting him back to the moment .
tr	6	She helped him the second time , then led him along the bank .
tr	8	I 've got to pack .
tr	8	A pitcher with wine and glasses awaited them and a servant girl was already pouring it for them , hands shaking .
tr	11	They camped wherever they found themselves when daylight ran out .
tr	8	He ran down the short hallway , past the men 's and ladies room , and started up the stairs .
tr	8	""" Ah , doctor , "" Alita said , "" so good to see you ."

tr	10	What really matters is that he 's incredibly loyal to Martin , Phillip , and myself .

tr	10	Why the problem with bringing Neil here to stay , Simon ?

tr	11	Eyes darted back and forth between the two images , trying to locate the faint lines ; many seconds ticked by .
tr	10	"Are you doing this on purpose ? """
tr	8	Ignoring this , I looked into Logan 's eyes , and the bleeding Jacob was forgotten .

tr	7	probably why I joined the SAS .

tr	9	My mind whirled to reconcile this new development , but then I looked down .
tr	11	She laughed and said , ' Don 't worry you 're in safe hands .
tr	8	""" Oh , do say you will , "" Theodosia said eagerly ."
tr	7	On my way to the bathroom I took off the cloak and packed back into my sack .
tr	7	Massaging it briefly , he pulled his hand away to look at it .
tr	7	I lifted my head slightly and brushed my lips against his neck .

tr	11	I zoomed in on his table overflowing with samples from his bakery .
tr	7	The Great Spirit would be angry , and so would the spirits of the dead victims .

tr	8	Abby accepted the Lars 's invitation , both of them dancing very closed .

tr	8	I could stay here for the next two hours , he thought .
tr	7	Up another set of stairs , although hardly like the grand , gilded , marbled ones I cherished all my life .

tr	9	""" I had the hot chocolate when we finished our kayak ."
tr	9	She never expect that Tristan would do that .
tr	8	""" Yes , almost like a mercenary of the spy world ."

tr	9	""" The black creatures have started to patrol the mountains ."
tr	6	He suddenly slowed down and his shoulder sagged .
tr	10	They moved north , as best they could tell , veering ever so slightly to their right .

tr	10	Chris did , but decided to say nothing for the moment .

tr	7	Picturing the odd man again , a shiver crept down his spine and he quickly shook the memory from his head .

tr	5	Their eyes met , one pair hunted and cloudy , the other wide and disbelieving .

tr	5	"But the most dangerous one sounds the best . """
tr	11	There were ten canoes with four warriors in each of them .

tr	7	At the left side of the photo sat an old man on a rickety stool .

tr	9	It 's called I Can 't Wish . '
tr	8	Brazen lifted his drink looking at the amber liquid .

tr	7	""" Would you like it with or without commercials , Rick ? """

tr	7	When the other two weren 't looking , the leader stabbed one and shot the other .

tr	11	groaned Michel , pushing Paul who was sitting on his body .
tr	8	Yes , he had been bathed at some point .
tr	5	In our case however , only immediate satisfaction would suffice .
tr	11	I watched the doorknob turn again and tried to quieten the rapid thuds of my heart .
tr	6	David thought for a few moments .
tr	7	""" As you are fully aware , my role is more advisory in nature . """
tr	6	""" Neil , "" a low voice said in his ear ."
tr	8	Unexpectedly , a wave of water forcefully flushed out of the hallway as the front doors exploded open .
tr	7	Stepping over the dead men , he scrambled up the stairs .
tr	11	Eventually my impatience reached boiling point and I stomped around the unit making as much noise as possible .
tr	9	She leaned up a little , easing the pressure on Bethany 's chest and neck .
tr	11	The entire incident was going to be covered up and forgotten .
tr	9	We landed heavily in a dimly lit passage on the other side and started to run .
tr	8	"Are these two kids giving you any trouble lah ? """
tr	8	Or maybe she could hold it in her mouth but then she 'd sneeze again .
tr	8	We walked in the next morning Allan was all smiles .
tr	9	Chuckles filled the cabin ; even Roberto revealed a grin before it disappeared again .
tr	7	The guy with the mermaid tattoo slapped Alejo on the shoulder .
tr	9	""" Relax sport , I 'm not going to hurt you . """
tr	10	It took a spider to bring me to my senses .
tr	10	""" This is neither the time nor place for you to act like spoiled children . """

tr	10	It was another woman looking at the rest of the scene .
tr	9	""" There 's nothing we can 't conquer ."
tr	8	The sentry tried to block our passage .
tr	11	He was now confident that it was ready to fire .
tr	6	Eda reined in her horse abruptly .
tr	6	""" These people are insane , "" said Jacob ."
tr	8	""" That was before I heard the horses . """
tr	6	Two seconds later , Malcolm punched him in the face with a solid right hook .

tr	9	Was she on speaking terms with every girl at Sydenham ?
tr	10	There is nothing they need from you .
tr	8	Brand took a step forward with his own sword , but Hilda looked back at him and glanced at him sternly .
tr	6	' Okay , you got me but what about the amp ? '
tr	9	The silver grey Audi picked him up as he went past High Wycombe .
tr	6	Resigned , and a little bit mad , the boy climbed back down to his forest .
tr	9	The worn trail was now cloaked in an ominous heaviness as if they were trespassing .

tr	7	Your brother is also working for us .

tr	5	""" Did your knowledgeable friends give you any other information ? """
tr	6	""" Is that satisfactory , Rick ? """

tr	9	The Priestess wrestled it under control , determinedly giving no sign of concern .
tr	6	A swoop and a slow , and they touched down on the desert floor with a thump .
tr	7	He gestured vaguely in my direction .
tr	7	""" No way , white bread , "" Jack told him , "" I 'm the gay Jewish black dude sidekick ."
tr	7	Furthermore , and most frustrating , Miss Cantwell had called her ' the little girl ' .
tr	6	"But I thought the new maid - "" "" The new maid quit last night ."
tr	9	Malcolm was stumbling up the stairs with some blonde hanging off him .
tr	9	An eerie feeling of familiarity stole over me again as I studied the older man 's face .
tr	10	""" I can 't tell which direction to go now ."
tr	7	Flaherty hadn 't fired the weapon during the battle .
tr	10	The oil rigs could be seen as either Food or Security depending on one 's viewpoint .
tr	10	""" I can 't believe we are discussing this ."
tr	8	He started to leave , but I was still desperate for answers .
tr	9	What if she only accepted that sort of comfort from Rand ?
tr	10	It makes me want to vomit .
tr	7	"It 's our necks if they escape . """
tr	7	"I left my school , and I jeopardized my scholarship , "" Neil said in quiet desperation ."
tr	6	""" So , funny story , "" I said , "" but Justin sent our food over to your table . """
tr	10	I knew he wanted to leave .
tr	7	What was done was done .
tr	7	He instinctively held out his blade firmly with two hands , and the rat impaled itself upon his sword edge .
tr	11	I wished Tuck was there so he could see .
tr	11	' You mean how easily we failed to see a charity case ? '
tr	6	""" Not by the fire , I am too warm . """
tr	9	""" If each company builds one set of airships , "" he said as he hit the enter key ."

tr	6	""" Thank you , Mr. Jones ; you have just earned your first flight pay ."
tr	9	The tracks were those of someone with a large size foot .
tr	10	""" It 's good to meet you all !"
tr	11	Again she felt he might be angry with her .
tr	6	The old man 's disgusted look on his face only got worse .
tr	9	Six men were visible , only one of them looking in his general direction .

tr	9	"You have one last choice to make , Alfred . """

tr	8	Next is THE SECRET IN THE HIDDEN CAVE Chapter 1 The key .
tr	6	"Kay has two goals , "" Christy cheerfully announced ."
tr	11	Taylor had not even considered that this tradition had survived in this remote area .
tr	7	Nathan and his family had fought off attackers on three occasions already .
tr	7	Ramdas , a man in his early fifties , was walking toward a little stationery and communication shop .
tr	8	""" I 'm sure you have ."
tr	8	He needed to sit down .
tr	10	There were several thin arms connected to the rim of the glasses .
tr	7	"Anyway , are we ready for this ? """
tr	7	""" At least I 'm not the only cripple in this institution ."
tr	11	David appeared to have lost his sense of purpose and balance .
tr	9	While Chris had been thinking those things , his mind drifted .
tr	10	After joining the motorways Amy started thinking the journey would never end .
tr	8	His long limbs are trapped in a baggy t-shirt and worn jeans .
tr	7	When they reached the tree line , Ted killed the engine and coasted to a stop .
tr	10	' We know she had travelling plans , but she should have been back in the lab this week . '
tr	5	A young gypsy boy entered the kitchen .
tr	8	He consumed it in the salt water , again feeling the power flow through his veins .

tr	6	Only one person in the world ever called him Bro .

tr	8	He had a choice of 105mm or 30 mm .
tr	8	They had me pinned good .
tr	9	They were driving on a long highway , speeding toward Arizona .
tr	9	If Dan doesn 't snap out of his injury soon , we 'll walk to town .
tr	5	Up ahead , at a T-shaped intersection , there was a crowd .
tr	6	""" Okay , how can you have this much Duke Ellington and no Dizzy Gillespie ? """
tr	8	The wind was less harsh than before but , it still was knocking them over .
tr	11	She had a disarming smile that instilled instant trust among the otherwise hard , sculpted features .
tr	7	""" Oh , pay no attention to it ; it 's just her natural feminine curiosity ."
tr	5	""" And spilling candy constitutes trouble ? """
tr	9	Again , Tsubasa raised his hand and the staff snapped to attention .
tr	9	Telling them what to do .
tr	8	The sound reminded her of wind chimes or a baby laughing , it was kind of musical .
tr	5	""" Hey , Mike , "" she said softly ."
tr	10	Her laugh sounded like a silver bell , sending flurries of butterflies into the air in agreement .
tr	10	You could have got yourself into a lot of trouble .
tr	7	Catching her with his free arm , Lord Quinn gently laid her on the stone floor .
tr	6	"In between laughs Kyle remarked , "" She isn 't even pregnant yet , and already she has morning sickness ! """
tr	11	She would be lucky to survive it herself .

tr	7	It will not be easy ; we have effectively introduced martial law , well , almost .
tr	9	It was the final straw , something in his core cracked and his software shuttered .
tr	6	They found him in the canal in Market Drayton .
tr	7	""" Uh -- Do it , "" she told Matthew and grabbed Stephanie 's hand just in case ."
tr	6	"And just please , don 't tell anybody . """

tr	8	""" Doctor Everett was always so very nice to me , "" Maya says with a smile ."
tr	11	""" Do you think these are humans ? """
tr	7	Wolf Eyes began the climb down the mountain -- his mind and body now ready for the conquest .

tr	9	She held her hands in front of her eyes and turned her back to Taylor .
tr	7	' Do they know this ? '
tr	5	""" And with the Ambassador , too , I 'll wager . """
tr	10	"It will be quite rough I 'm afraid . """
tr	10	I believe it is coming from outside ... like a laser beam of energy or something .

tr	8	She wished she had a choice .
tr	9	Who knew what would happen .

tr	6	This is not the case however with the ultra violet rays hitting glass .
tr	7	As he thought this , he realized the irony and laughed to himself .
tr	10	""" As much as I like the exercise , "" he starts , scanning the distance for anything worth noting ."

tr	11	Do we light it and then ask for the wish to go away ?
tr	7	The first thing that I saw was Laurence 's beautiful masculine face .

tr	11	"Let us go see how close we can get . """
tr	8	""" We also found two thousand yellow tablets in with those hooky cigarettes , "" he told me ."
tr	8	It looked like a piece of nylon .

tr	9	Chief Broken Bow wanted to endure the stench no longer , so he turned and left the house .
tr	10	Her morning had been off to a slow start since her boss was in Brussels .
tr	10	Its fore legs twitched beneath it as the dog tried to stand .
tr	7	Seconds later , the driver slammed on the brakes once more and brought the heavy vehicle to a quick stop .
tr	11	There are things I need to know .
tr	11	They were written in figures she cannot decipher .
tr	8	Next , he carefully started dragging himself up the slope , still using the gun case as an anchor .
tr	6	Will our power abandon us , or has it begun already ?
tr	9	""" Sir , why would you think that I wanted any more assistance from you ? """
tr	10	So she thought you were drunk because of ze bottle and your breath .

tr	7	The pungent smell of sagebrush filled her nose , and she included it in her anger .
tr	10	""" So not only do we want him dead , but the Empire does as well . """
tr	7	' Are they firing at us ? '

tr	6	A second man joined him quickly , and then many more .
tr	10	I 'm sorry for lying to you .
tr	5	More specifically , it was his home town , Grimsley .
tr	11	No compass just his native instinct , his bare feet seemingly impervious to what was underfoot ... .
tr	11	I deflected all his strikes with an ease that enraged him to no end .
tr	7	He was huge and had a thick brown beard and wild , uncut hair .
tr	6	I checked for a pulse .
tr	7	The crumbs blew out of her mouth as she spoke .
tr	11	She tried to walk forward struggling with her luggage .
tr	7	I spun and kicked out , taking out the three remaining Hunters .

tr	6	""" Well , then , could you just tell me it ? """
tr	8	He punched the accelerator all the way to the floor , throwing the woman back in her seat .
tr	10	Carlos and Kendall stepped around Mark , watching Josie pouring water on the cut .
tr	7	And yet he did not move , did not even realize the danger -- likely could not even fathom it .
tr	8	he asked as he handed Gavin the shovel .
tr	7	His sword , fallen from his hand , could not be touched .
tr	6	""" Listen , stupid gnome breath , the rope is too tight ! """
tr	8	"Dane looked grim , "" It wasn 't with his body , and I didn 't see it ."

tr	7	Before today was over , they 'd all be rich too .
tr	8	What was he supposed to do ?
tr	7	""" It was in our most basic studies at the Air Force Academy , Mr. Bishop ."
tr	11	The danger would be minimal compared to running openly from the black creatures .
tr	9	The scent of rot , earth , and the juices of the grave filled Kai 's nostrils .
tr	11	""" Aye , but I couldn 't help seeing the beauty of you two fine ladies through the glass . """
tr	6	The woman in the camel coat lifted a hand and waved .
tr	6	""" In some areas , yes , though in my experience , too much control could be a bad thing . """

tr	8	The turret tore at the walls , annihilating everything in its path .

tr	11	He looked down at the book he held in his hands .
tr	8	I have to do this .
tr	5	""" So your eyes are really grey ? """
tr	8	""" I found him dead in the stables ."
tr	8	The drama and excitement had completely wiped away his calm and relaxed attitude from only a minute before .
tr	7	Over the next ten minutes , Reid and I explained about our involvement with the FBI and the French detective .
tr	11	Fourteen Mason watched Amanda 's Mini pull away from the park , then checked his phone , again .

tr	8	I couldn 't handle losing my only friend .

tr	11	It could only have come from Someone greater than they , Someone all-powerful and all-knowing .
tr	9	"Do you love him ? """
tr	7	I blinked at him ; the look troubled me .

tr	8	It 's everything about this day and the hunger still here , growing loud .

tr	6	It was the article and the print date was the following day .
tr	6	""" Sarah , I need your opinion , "" she said ."
tr	10	"He turned back to me "" Of course their attention is focused on the Trojan Devices at the moment ."
tr	10	They all joined in a spirited conversation again recounting the events of the previous day .
tr	11	John explained what he had been told about the murder squad .
tr	11	Anna shouted as she tried to get away .
tr	6	It was far , however many miles away it was .
tr	9	How he knows what he does is troubling enough .
tr	6	""" No , "" the Queen promptly refutes , batting it away ."

tr	8	""" I am at home here , "" she answered in Malay , "" more at home than in England ."
tr	10	""" But they 'll definitely kill anyone who finds out the truth ."
tr	10	There were shuffling sounds nearby and Victoria felt a breeze -- something had crossed in front of her .
tr	11	I blocked the latter with my leg , spinning with it into a round house that he ducked .
tr	5	""" A big red and white car . """
tr	9	That definitely would 've made me look guilty .

tr	6	' All right , ' he finally muttered with a curt nod .
tr	11	"Did you see it work ? """
tr	5	In the crystal clear water , turquoise and dark blue spots follow one another .
tr	11	""" I have another concern - where is the end of the building ?"
tr	8	They 're out here by themselves , on the fringe , no one will believe them if they tell .
tr	7	they hollered back and kept paddling .
tr	9	What made you attempt it ? '
tr	5	""" Oh , a sister , "" he said , seeming mollified ."
tr	6	""" What your father did is not your fault Gabe ."
tr	6	We walked for a further fifteen minutes through the Trojan Devices .
tr	11	He now has time to make a run for the vents .
tr	11	She wiggled out and we locked arms , unable to move each other .
tr	10	Chris had approached Barney in a quiet moment to offer his gratitude , but the old man merely looked surprised .
tr	9	The war party , some of the braves using the old canoes , made its way across the river .
tr	10	Jeff could feel the shark beginning to weaken .
tr	6	"I added a banana to her supper last night . """
tr	11	I keep thinking about how everything has changed .
tr	11	"Do you wish to proceed ? """
tr	11	I knew we had to act fast .
tr	10	For a moment I was forgotten , laying there amidst the snow .
tr	7	Suddenly , as she dashed up the street yet again , Melody had an epiphany .
tr	7	""" Some poison , I don 't know very much more , "" he began ."
tr	7	' Put the knife down , don 't be so disgusting , ' shouted my Mum from the bar .
tr	7	""" OK , let 's get ready for school , "" Tori said and threw the walkie talkie in her bag ."
tr	7	' He 's alright , ' she said giving her bearded partner a wave .
tr	7	Opening his mind 's eye to this process , Cole immediately saw the room in an altogether different light .
tr	11	There is no set schedule you have to follow .
tr	9	she said sort off intentionally , ready to eat .
tr	8	""" I suppose I did , "" she said ."
tr	7	The squad was led by a Lieutenant .
tr	7	""" Are you fit to ride ?"
tr	10	He hoped the pilot was doing better than him .
tr	11	Adele murmured her apologies , and continued to pull the comb through Eda 's hair .
tr	7	Nevertheless , the upper arm looked much better , and he was sleeping soundly .
tr	5	""" Yeah , right , "" Kevin Manning , the head trainer called out ."
tr	8	""" We employed Steve as a land surveyor before he built his Pyramid scheme , right ? """
tr	9	Josie stepped behind Mark and grabbed a bottle of water from the cooler - one of only a few left .
tr	7	And Job , tall rangy Job : a good Biblical name that , Toby had always thought .
tr	9	Of course we invited him to continue his wanderings with us .
tr	9	His head beginning to ache , the concepts of sovereignty and loyalty remain just outside of his realm of comprehension .
tr	6	Yeah , Camden really didn 't like his sister much right now .
tr	6	Chapter 3 The drive to Evie 's cousin Jess ' house was quick , only fifteen minutes from our dorm .
tr	7	He took the gum from his mouth and stared at the glob .
tr	8	""" Have you any background with a blade ? """
tr	11	The Seeker motioned to a guard - of which , the Prince realized suddenly , there was now only one .
tr	8	Well that 's likely the highest compliment the sour old sore ever gave !
tr	10	Scott looked around the bones again but saw nothing that even closely resembled a wallet .
tr	9	When Lethal returned to the Officer 's Mess , the three platoon commanders were on their way out .
tr	7	"Dublin city is the capital of non British Ireland . """
tr	8	But speaking of Phillip , are we to kill him tonight ?
tr	6	""" So you see , me services are invaluable , "" the lad prompted with a cheeky grin ."
tr	11	"But Dr. Crawford had to be eliminated , thanks to you . """
tr	7	""" It is the place of an evil wizard ."
tr	6	My face crumbling , my heart shattering , dropping to my knees beside his limp body .
tr	10	The tiny reflection of the clearing rippled on the water 's surface with her breath and the lattice shifted with it .
tr	5	""" Yeah , "" Tori answered and they went upstairs ."
tr	8	"But we 'll check all the trash barrels before leaving . """
tr	7	She didn 't have any friends , not here anyway .
tr	8	He had seen her in action , she was formidable .
tr	6	That , however , seemed rather like a side note to my current predicament .
tr	6	""" Yes , we 're very sorry , Joe "" said Vivian ."
tr	5	Sure enough , a missed call , three text messages and a voice mail .
tr	5	Not just his laugh , but her own , too ; any laugh , really .
tr	10	"I was sweating like a bluefin on hot sand , I tell you . """
tr	10	""" Told you it would be worth it . """
tr	9	Their muscles were tired of the exercise but they forced themselves to move forward .
tr	6	Why hadn 't the sheriff discovered a car ?
tr	8	""" Pick up your tools and get back to work ! """
tr	11	Ashlyn realized she wanted to understand Maddox .
tr	11	""" What 's to be done with him after this ?"
tr	8	When they went into the parallel passageway , they stopped behind Wolf Eyes and Wounded Eagle .
tr	8	Gan knew there were thirty .
tr	11	Allan sent notes telling of one delay after another finally a month after we got back there was something concrete .
tr	7	This here , the grueling research , this is where the real breaks come .
tr	10	"Anything to get you to leave WITHOUT my daughter ! """
tr	7	""" No , "" Jim said , "" You do ... "" Jim Stalin knew his comic books better than anyone ."
tr	10	Straining to breathe , she held him close , squeezing his head against her bosom until he regained his senses .
tr	10	They thus reflected the light at various angles making the interior of the building invisible .
tr	9	Layla ignored the murmured words that followed her .
tr	6	She gasped with delight and shock .
tr	8	We checked the complex but found no sign of human activity .
tr	9	She loved getting under Robert 's skin .
tr	5	A Little Ice Age , or God forbid , a major Ice Age .
tr	8	I wonder how far it 's gone .
tr	8	Even in the gravity of the situation Noah noticed the admiration in Mariposa 's voice .
tr	8	It was by now completely dark with thick cloud cover , which suited her purpose .
tr	8	""" I am looking forward to it already , "" Taylor answered smilingly ."
tr	7	Over the mounting din of the quaking ground , they looked down into the valley below .
tr	9	Cassidy knows that Michael Greenwood is her one true love -- he just doesn 't know it .
tr	9	It was Adele 's turn to look surprised .
tr	7	"He 's up in the far pasture looking for you . """
tr	9	""" How long they been celebrating Kwanzaa in Africa ? """
tr	11	"Are you saying they 're possessed ? """
tr	9	For being there for her .
tr	10	I started to hate seeing you .
tr	7	They gave no indication of it .
tr	6	""" What if they shoot again ?"
tr	7	""" Is there a fence or anything ? """
tr	11	He knew what was about to happen .
tr	8	They were sick of the changes , tired of the Revolution , and scared for their own necks .
tr	9	This is going to be my new spot .
tr	11	I didn 't think I needed looking after .
tr	8	"You will be much stronger than I ever was , however . """
tr	5	""" No , please , "" she whispered , "" I. . . """
tr	9	Laying him down , I shut his eyes and covered my work by shifting his jacket .
tr	11	He needed to know if she was there as well .
tr	9	he shouted as he shook the bound man like a rag doll .
tr	6	""" Hmmm , "" Gabe 's fingers skate lightly across the keyboard ."
tr	9	We 're about thirty minutes away if traffic works in our favor .
tr	10	""" Well , what do you got ? """
tr	10	""" I translate the language both here and in the other time-space , Rick , "" she answered ."
tr	8	Both stared at each other without saying anything .
tr	11	They ended up being classified as volunteers -- not employees .
tr	6	""" I got home fine , "" said Colette merrily , and I felt all warm and fuzzy ."
tr	8	""" Thanks Atticus , "" I yelled at the top of my lungs ."
tr	6	""" What 's the matter , dear ? """
tr	8	I paused in the act of loading firearms and magazines into the second bag .
tr	8	Ganondorf shouts , fed up with their endless banter .
tr	11	""" Do you want to say something ? """
tr	6	Dad 's silence told me everything .
tr	7	Sofia turn around and found the hooded , young man few pace from her .
tr	11	The disembodied voice seemed to emanate from all around us .
tr	7	' We don 't often see new immortals around here , ' he continued in the same light-hearted tone .
tr	8	He stood up and took her into his arms and held her .
tr	11	And yet it remained just out of reach , thwarted by a pair of irritations .
tr	9	Army logistics had provided a stock of tea for their British staff but it was horrid .
tr	5	Not a gloomy , dark sort of gray , but light , almost silver .
tr	9	He just never thought that one day he would be such a kid .
tr	9	He 'd tried to lure us out before .
tr	10	""" Okay , if you want to then , "" said Waving Willow ."
tr	9	"It also might explain how your rifle got hit . """
tr	9	This lord shall have no equal among men and will vanquish them from the lands .
tr	11	"If not , then I will have proof against him if he causes problems for us later . """
tr	8	The light relaxed Marcus , put his soul at ease .
tr	8	""" Let 's hope so , "" Camden found himself whispering to Percival ."
tr	9	Then , just as she started opening the door , she turned around and sadly looked at Simon .
tr	8	We had dinner with Joyce , Sam , and a couple of the scientific party .
tr	8	She drove back to the farm in a contemplative mood .
tr	9	Theo took a date and a glass after Angelique had been served .
tr	11	"Then they use the copies to help them get to their destination . """
tr	9	' He never usually strays , you know , ' she said while showing me to a seat .
tr	8	I stayed there , never sleeping , until dawn .
tr	5	""" Ah , shit , "" Julian Garrett said , weary and resigned ."
tr	10	He shifted and experimentally tilted his head against hers so that they leaned against each other .
tr	8	Please , allow me to return the favor .
tr	8	""" And that is why she 's here . """
tr	11	He turned to the soldier who held the horse 's reign .
tr	10	The wind knocked out of him , he grabs at his chest , attempting to catch his breath .
tr	8	There she thrust them into the heart of the blaze .
tr	11	She had not even realised that she had become emotionally involved .
tr	6	""" Come on , "" she muttered , and started down the hall ."
tr	9	Given us time to grow .
tr	9	"Shocked , Simon asked , "" How the devil did you know about that ? """
tr	8	"He took another look and wearily nodded , "" It 's the right one . """
tr	7	""" He has the legs of ten men . """
tr	7	"On his shoulder , beneath the golden dragon emblem is a silver "" X "" symbol ."
tr	6	She was tall , her looming height made even greater by the four-inch stiletto heels on her leather boots .
tr	6	The few people in gainful employment worked for minimal , subsistence wages .
tr	7	He didn 't appear nervous , but I couldn 't be certain .
tr	11	Ganondorf 's eyelid descends and the feeling of pelting rain fades as his body is overwhelmed with warmth .
tr	7	"Get lost in the mountains . """
tr	10	But she was ... what ?
tr	10	"Not that kind of bill , the kind you find on a bird ! """
tr	9	I put a hand on his arm and felt the rigid tension running through him .
tr	7	"Old life , gone , gone gone ... and more gone . """
tr	9	I sat up on the bench and tried to rub my eye .
tr	10	She well knew that he disliked the confines of a chair at any time .
tr	11	He glanced at the morning light that came through the entrance to the house .
tr	10	The three tiers seemed to spiral up one into the other , moving with the contours of the landscape .
tr	11	The noise had woken up the two dogs asleep in their baskets in the mud room .
tr	7	There was one final cry from outside .
tr	7	the nurse with the clogs snapped , then turned back to Alejo .
tr	8	Chapter 24 Conway 's vantage point at the tail of the column allowed him to watch the others .
tr	8	And Michael and Ben now saw themselves when they were tiny babies .
tr	8	After a couple of hours they stopped to stretch their legs .
tr	7	He held a cup of coffee in his hands .
tr	6	His father runs a huge publishing business ; his mother 's a doctor ; his sister is a college professor .
tr	8	The lieutenant seemed totally calm and composed , the distinct opposite of his earlier behavior .
tr	9	A dimpled smile appeared as she cuddled deeper into him .
tr	5	The Hat and the Nomad We went up a small ridge .
tr	7	And with the new king 's summons , I would live for this .
tr	8	""" I have no doubt you would . """
tr	7	""" Later , "" I told her , holding open the door ."
tr	9	I could have refused to shake .
tr	10	Trojan Keeper or not , I couldn 't figure out if he was an ally or an enemy .
tr	7	The conductors prodded the chained prisoners and pushed Simon and Miriam , and they all shuffled towards the figure .
tr	5	""" The Capitol , to Prince Daniel , "" Catherine informed him ."
tr	9	Reaching the door , he wastes no time tearing it open and dashing through .
tr	10	The captain was still sitting on the chair , as white as a sheet , miserably in pain .
tr	11	Claire hunkered down to watch , ignoring the quiet chatter of the couples behind her .
tr	7	Barney turned to Chris and smiled , then excused himself .
tr	10	They fixed their clubs and bows so they would not be in their way .
tr	11	You 'll have to turn ' em around .
tr	11	"Drew nodded , "" That 's what I was thinking too ."
tr	5	"~ ~ 0 ~ ~ 0 ~ ~ Phil exclaims , "" Two days ! """
tr	7	"Abby spoke first , "" I 'm Abby . """
tr	6	The sleeves of his shirt were rolled up .
tr	8	""" They brought it up from the black tunnels below the catacombs ."
tr	9	""" Everything will be fine with you my dear ."
tr	8	A cacophony of horns blasted from the matchbox cars snaking along below .
tr	10	However , he likes to challenge himself and write in other genres as well .
tr	8	Then with a sharp intake of breath he performed his snare drum fill and began playing .
tr	11	You are here because you have to be and eventually you will leave .
tr	11	All visitors were permanently tracked in NET 's database , which was continuously archived .
tr	8	Neil slithered behind her , feeling the loose rocks slide under his feet .
tr	6	""" Yes , of course , "" sighed Alfred ."
tr	7	"Other places along the river were much wider and deeper with more soft bottoms and currents . """
tr	11	I 'm writing this down because I was asked to by Serious Sally .
tr	10	It was a beautiful sight and worth it to dawdle along the path .
tr	9	The team had a telepath attached to them , call sign Echo .
tr	8	Nathan smiled in spite of his annoyance .
tr	8	"Oh , you look ... "" elf eyes filled with mirth , "" ... oh god , you look ridiculous . """
tr	10	""" Son , you have no reason to follow my path , "" said Anderson compassionately ."
tr	10	' In fact , as Head of Counter Terrorism , I don 't even need their approval to arrest you . '
tr	6	""" Wake up , "" answered Finan wearily ."
tr	7	""" Leave him alone , Finn , "" David snarled ."
tr	10	I wondered if I 'd see my friend from the gastropub yesterday .
tr	11	It was funny to have a pillow fight after eating .
tr	6	""" Don 't ask , "" The Author said , "" It 'll explain itself later . """
tr	6	He was weakened but still deadly .
tr	9	He took it very well , staggering only slightly , the protruding shaft no encumbrance .
tr	11	""" You know how CDs or computer chips would look to someone a hundred years ago ?"
tr	8	Claire nuzzled into the soft blonde hair and let it hide her tears .
tr	6	""" I am so sorry , my good captain , my manners are unforgivable ."
tr	9	""" So what are you going to do ? """
tr	9	She pulled with all her might as Trae pushed with his feet .
tr	10	""" I wonder if you have the answer to the question , "" he said ."
tr	8	His dad 's presence made the world feel a safer place .
tr	6	""" I 'm dying , "" the big man whispered ."
tr	9	Frankie dropped down first then Nancy until it was Gray , Malcolm , and me .
tr	8	""" What are you doing sneaking around my place ?"
tr	5	But no , she wanted the glitz , glamour , flash and fame .
tr	11	At first he was able to move his big toe , Mr. Big 's favorite .
tr	6	""" A most fitting trio , you , your dress and the roses all go together very beautifully . """
tr	6	""" Now , now ... enough of you , both . """
tr	10	He took the knife and used it to pick beneath his fingernails .
tr	5	"CHAPTER SIX SPRING 2008 "" My God , Maryellen , what is she thinking ?"
tr	7	""" I know , I know , "" said Archie , more than a little embarrassed ."
tr	5	The villagers ' sad tale , however , gave some clue .
tr	7	""" Hmm , "" she purred softly , "" this is nice ."
tr	5	""" Mike , no , "" she said ."
tr	9	He charged her naked body and quickly parted with all of his own clothing as well .
tr	9	No doubt she 's been given plenty of cause for nightmares .
tr	8	"He mines for precious stones like the kind floating around in your overpriced drink . """
tr	7	A second body was visible through it .
tr	9	' It looks like they intentionally designed it that way . '
tr	9	The hair on the back of Josie 's neck was up .
tr	5	"Ivy Pierce , Ryder Sutton and his lovely girlfriend Kenna Lee , "" Chase offered politely ."
tr	8	""" Come on fellas , just cough up and let 's get out of here , "" ordered Mark ."
tr	7	I smiled faintly and followed him to the hangar .
tr	10	""" Oh , the guys who kick the ball into the net ? """
tr	10	I turn around and look at the figure sitting behind the desk .
tr	8	""" You think we 're crazy ."
tr	9	"Hunt roared out in laughter , "" I do have a change of clothes or two here in my waist pack ."
tr	10	Again , whilst drifting into a world of pain , Simon 's fall continued through the last layer .
tr	7	The probe instantly slips into her ear canal and finds the link to her cerebral cortex .
tr	9	His legs were terribly sore from riding , and his back ached horribly .
tr	6	""" I 'm sorry , "" I say ."
tr	9	He averted it a shade too late , but held his ground with nervous defiance as Gan approached him .
tr	11	""" Aren 't they taking long ? """
tr	8	Toby absently drew imaginary lines between the planets on the Milky Way Galaxy wall with his index finger .
tr	7	When I left he wasn 't despondent , but it 's all so sudden .
tr	9	"Sofia turned to the princess and asked , "" Who locked you up here ? """
tr	9	But there is no need to keep the girl .
tr	5	""" See , there , "" he mumbled , his tone suddenly distant again ."
tr	8	""" Oh , shit , "" Sarah said when she saw it ."
tr	6	Only then did the fabled resemblance strike Joey 's two Palm Beach based co-workers .
tr	7	The woman in the white uniform brought a tray to his bed and put it on the round table .
tr	7	We clashed and threw each other back from the stalemate .
tr	6	The dangerous goods compartment held some basic , yet important scientific equipment .
tr	9	""" Captain I 'm sorry but I couldn 't tip my hand not even to you ."
tr	9	Even with your speech now that you have stepped away from the craft .
tr	9	""" I guess he couldn 't leave and he couldn 't stay ."
tr	8	""" They 're not even really tied , "" John said pulling his hands out of the bind ."
tr	6	"This one is from my personal secret recipe . """
tr	7	""" But it has spoken to you ."

tr	10	On stage Calvin meant every word until he had no more to sing .
tr	7	""" Yes , of course , Roberto , she is tired after the long journey ."
tr	10	I was afraid to stop talking .
tr	8	"This whole exercise was just to buy Melody some time . """
tr	10	But we 've got to go more than a thousand miles , hauling a reluctant Prince along the way .
tr	7	Grass tickled my ankles , and I gripped his hand tighter .
tr	11	""" What sort of old man could allow himself to fire harmful rays at children ? """
tr	8	The giant looked about to respond , but then caught himself and turned to the Prince with a smile .
tr	7	The priest drew a pistol and began shooting .
tr	11	Also , do you want samples of the sheep 's blood ?
tr	9	Connor sensed fear in Billy 's eyes as he came closer with each step .
tr	5	' No , you weren 't , but that other man was .
tr	9	It actually seemed like a valid excuse , and it was one that her parents would believe .
tr	10	He turned hearing screaming behind him as a dark figure closed in .
tr	7	He shuffled over to the right-hand side bench and collapsed into a sitting position .
tr	7	But besides Melody , his brother Francis also wanted him to leave .
tr	7	He felt no anger , no remorse , and also no hope .
tr	8	He pressed a button on the side of the cage .
tr	10	Think about what happened to them .
tr	10	I wondered why I missed seeing it earlier .
tr	9	He possessed highly advanced reasoning skills but could , at best , be described as a bumbling child genius .
tr	9	""" I thought you 'd have one . """
tr	11	I have friends I have to help .
tr	10	A mighty wind that howls at me the mountain , and I will face them .
tr	8	As hard as she tried , her body refused to react properly .
tr	9	As he rubbed my back and ran his fingers through my hair , I didn 't know how to feel .
tr	10	He was in front of them , in the direction they were traveling .
tr	6	Her unrequited love for him ?
tr	8	""" You 'll give me a bruise , or even worse , you 'll untie my cravat !"
tr	9	I was struck by a wave of guilt .
tr	9	I lifted my eyes to the skies and saw a clear view of the stars , already I missed my kin .
tr	9	Gabriel 's violin was also resting on sapphire velvet in its case on a clean work table .
tr	7	Crossing his fingers again , he hoped , but again , there was no need .
tr	8	She didn 't got a kick ass from Damian , but definitely from me she will have it .
tr	9	She didn 't need to say it .
tr	8	""" Yes , you may verify it , of course "" she replied ."
tr	8	Only the paintings in the drawing room and bedrooms had been left untouched .
tr	6	""" Frank , it 's your editor , "" a gruff voice answered ."
tr	7	"Come unlock the gate , "" Melody called out in a rather loud , urgent whisper ."
tr	6	In less than two-dozen heartbeats , Lewis Todd had nearly leveled the room .
tr	7	He ticked each response off on his fingers .
tr	11	He looked more closely at the man who seemed so professional and serene .
tr	9	"We are going to take back the castle . """
tr	8	"She wants to enslave them . """
tr	10	""" Oh , we 'll never hear the end of that now , I suppose . """
tr	11	She can paint and use pencils not only to make notes .
tr	9	As her breathing begins to shallow , Link gently hums her song as he rocks her in his arms .
tr	9	Early Saturday morning they ate breakfast and packed sandwiches and drinks for a picnic along the way .
tr	8	Dozens of absurd faces from mummies to princesses to demons .
tr	7	A scowl dawned on Bruno 's face .
tr	9	"It gets dark in an hour or so , is everyone healthy enough to speed up ? """
tr	7	Neil dragged his eyes from the horizon and focused on her .
tr	8	Logic told her the expressions were friendly .

tr	11	"Who 'd wan na stick around for that ? """
tr	7	Then he clenched his jaw , sure , and climbed to his feet , staring at the workbench .
tr	7	Phillip 's presiding at the hanging .
tr	11	Harrison charged at Pike who had just regained his feet .
tr	7	He called the dogs in , got out of his boots and went into the study .
tr	9	Nevertheless , tender green shoots struggled for sunlight , tinting the rolling land with an eager glow .
tr	11	""" Let 's hope this isn 't their last visit . """
tr	9	""" Breakfast will be served in your cabin but all other meals will be eaten with the captain . """
tr	9	The weather continued to bully the earth with a mischievous grin .
tr	7	""" Something came up , box up my usual and run it over to the station with the prisoners ."
tr	8	VIN left his new legs on while bathing ; they were now a permanent part of his body .
tr	10	We could 've stopped to untie 'em !

tr	10	Why had she decided to betray her in this way ?
tr	7	""" But it may , close the grounds and have all staff to bunkers in a drill . """
tr	7	A tear snaked down Milne 's sunken cheek , her tiny nose turned red , and her mouth pursed .

tr	7	A clattering of hooves echoed through the otherwise silent morning .
tr	10	Then we proved it by booking not one but three .

tr	10	The concern was the obvious link to Indonesia and their pasts in the jungles of Borneo .
tr	11	""" I regret that my visit is not one of simple purpose , but I must seek your council . """
tr	9	""" Underneath he 's really a lovable teddy bear with an affection for guns ."
tr	5	""" Oh , boo hoo hoo , the poor little abused Bane ."
tr	7	They were in Lord Rafe 's personal chambers .
tr	7	Tate smiled , nodding understanding .
tr	7	The two went quiet for a while after that .
tr	10	Do what you need to do .
tr	9	""" This room was a coffin for over a year , "" he explains with annoyance ."
tr	11	He couldn 't blame her , really , but he personally wished she were wrong about that .

tr	10	The Devil Spirit looked down on them with a glare that made the men cry out .

tr	9	Iris , on the other hand , was troubled by the appearance of a potential rival .
tr	8	"Although one day he will need to know the whole story ! """
tr	10	I guess I 'll be seeing you .
tr	9	"Or , at least , the trickery is at an end now that you 're here before me . """
tr	9	"Then one said , "" Jus where your ship ? """
tr	9	He was one to talk .
tr	7	The European then used his spare hand and reached inside of his jacket holster .
tr	9	With the low glass coffee table in the middle of the room there was barely space to turn around .
tr	5	So blond and tan and , wow , he had some big baby blues .
tr	7	Suddenly , the horror of the day pressed into him with a vengeance and it hurt .
tr	8	Though she smiled , Chris knew she was worried .
tr	8	For his part , Jonesy had never been married , except to his aircraft .
tr	7	He looked away and strained his ears for any sounds from another carriage .
tr	7	"Rick lowered her quickly to the ground , "" Stay with me , girls ! """
tr	7	She ran her fingers through her hair and sighed .
tr	7	He draped his arms casually on the chair , forcing a relaxed pose .
tr	7	I looked up and saw a person standing in the living room doorway .
tr	5	""" Well , well , well , isn 't this cosy ? """
tr	11	""" You say the group carrying my half of the Talisman went missing ? """

tr	11	It stunk that she couldn 't know about his work , and especially about the assignment Gabriel was on today .

tr	10	They stayed there for a long while , waiting for the changing of the guard .
tr	11	That 's all we had to do .
tr	8	She reached her left hand out and felt up and down the bark of the tree .
tr	6	Through blank and pallor faces , some stared out into nothingness as shock deadened reality .
tr	6	' Point taken ' , change of subject .
tr	9	Another couple and their bored looking teenage son were doing some window shopping outside one of the galleries .
tr	7	After they left Tori took out her phone and dialed her dad 's number .

tr	6	Roast turkey , a separate pan of walnut stuffing , bread pudding .
tr	5	Later , in our bedroom , Henry and I didn 't speak .
tr	11	Hailey recognized the sound of a small body being dragged deeper through interior passages .
tr	7	Gavin spoke to her again , this time louder and closer .
tr	8	I 'll talk with Joseph , hear his next move , reconvene with you two , and go on from there .
tr	6	His second smiled and continued with the conversation .
tr	8	He would be a good husband to her .

tr	9	Ted thought he must be hallucinating .
tr	11	The gypsy strode into the bedroom and threw back the door where it crashed into the wall with a bang .
tr	10	Miriam whispered something that was too quiet for the governess to hear .
tr	11	Before any of them had a chance to speak , a single shot rang out , then another .
tr	9	The thought was cold even while the words made his blood hot .
tr	9	"He will take care of you , "" his father informed him ."
tr	10	The Roosevelt Island was a splash of autumnal red and yellows against the dark waters of the Potomac River below .
tr	9	He was afraid to touch her .
tr	10	He sat on a bench , towel over his shoulders , listening to the crowd roaring .
tr	9	""" This just happens to be the late Archduke 's special friend . """
tr	7	Kevin took two water buckets to the lake and filled them up .
tr	5	""" No , "" Rick waved her off ."
tr	8	The metal was cold and he felt the chill of naked metal against his skin .
tr	11	Suppose we ought to invite him over ?
tr	10	"A murmured exchange followed , during which the word "" procedure "" was repeated several times in German ."
tr	8	""" And thank God for the trees , or the moonlight would have given me away . """
tr	6	Instead , he grabbed her hand , pulled her in , and claimed her lips .
tr	9	He decided the bare truth would work best .
tr	9	She was feminine , full of light and laughter but at the same time she could be a real tomboy .
tr	8	All in all his face was , she thought , very expressive .
tr	9	to his escaping companions and to those still running and jumping crazily who didn 't have sense enough to run away .
tr	6	""" I am officially giving my resignation ."
tr	6	In human form again , Sadie made her way cautiously down toward the main floor .

tr	10	They had emerged from the belt of leaves , and stared down into the lower reaches of the forest .
tr	8	""" This is where you found her ? """
tr	7	The best misdirection always had a grain of truth in it .
tr	10	""" Sorry , "" she repeated flatly , tears rolling down her face , "" You didn 't look sorry ."

tr	10	I was pretty certain Zeal would harbour no such concerns .

tr	9	Reid cursed as he slammed into the door .
tr	11	""" I 'm sure they did send attendants , and that something happened to them . """
tr	9	replied Giorgio , surprised that such a question came from his friend .
tr	8	There was complete silence , except for Jake 's growl .
tr	6	He studied the small , pudgy Major Pan , his little hands , his appeasing voice , his benevolent smile .
tr	7	She gave him another angelic smile and tipped his chin up with one cool fingertip .
tr	11	Ed shouldered his way past to see Burt and Hank wrestling on the ground .
tr	8	The enemy 's legs were weakening , and he began to stumble .
tr	10	The keep was built over several .
tr	6	His eyes were cold , his face was relaxed , his arms did not tremble .
tr	8	The Turks were nearly frightened to death and immediately leaped from the boat into the water .
tr	8	Logan cried out , blood flowing from the wound .
tr	7	We 'll see about that .
tr	7	Then , embarrassed at last , he looked around sheepishly and fell silent .
tr	7	So far , Sebastian didn 't have any long-term girlfriend and his relationships were not deep .
tr	9	However it had happened , most looked as if they still wore clothes from the donation bin .
tr	8	And I think I will follow .

tr	11	I don 't remember ever pretending to be a bride .
tr	5	And near the fireplace , there was a blackened armchair .
tr	9	Hailey jumped to the ground from the planter and turned to look back .
tr	11	A dim glow surfaces upon turning a corner , a torch , freshly lit but barely burning .
tr	5	""" He loves it . """
tr	5	""" Yes , they also eat oats , straw , carrots and apples . """

tr	11	The second SUV swung around the smashed up vehicle with a sharp squeal of tires .

tr	7	He was conserving his energy , but his breathing sounded controlled and even .

tr	6	' Oh , it really is you , ' said a sharp voice behind her .
tr	10	What kind of father would I be to leave my girl in their hands ?

tr	9	Trying to calm myself , I took a long moment to breathe the crisp air around us .

tr	9	She knew Miss Julie was also a first born .
tr	5	Please , Stella , I really need your help this time .
tr	7	They focused on their beloved idol and their own safety .
tr	7	A shiver ran down my spine for the second time that day .
tr	8	The recently collected rocks kept it from falling over .
tr	8	""" Are we done here ? """
tr	7	Danny looked at her but she shook her head ; message received , message understood .
tr	10	They both became very thirsty and needed to get out of the hot sun .
tr	7	It was too late , the floor beneath his feet vanished and yet he did not fall .
tr	10	When a situation of turmoil presents itself , you look to people of authority for support and guidance .
tr	11	So they shun us as those who turned their back on the land .
tr	10	They had no choice but to obey my father 's command .

tr	9	The possibility of being kidnapped and tortured obviously added a new dimension to the projects .

tr	7	To the left , taking cover behind a makeshift barricade , were Victor , Anatole and a dozen Bastian Hunters .
tr	8	Even though at times he 'd freak me out , I still loved my brother Eden .
tr	8	The shelves were lined with everything from Robert Burns and Oscar Wilde to H.G. Wells and William Shakespeare .

tr	7	Her lips pressed together , but her eyes stayed on the road .
tr	9	But it took us some time to come to that place .
tr	6	For all his privilege and nice hair and confident shoulders , he was no better than me .
tr	10	"We would rest there when we played in the harbor . """
tr	9	At last , at last he was starting to get somewhere !
tr	8	He chuckled , the sound trembling through her and she clenched her fists as he continued .
tr	11	Roberto was so relieved that he grabbed her body in a fierce embrace , kissing the ice-cold face with desperate kisses .
tr	7	""" What an excellent question , one I have asked myself constantly over the years ."
tr	9	He felt the danger of their plan hum in his blood .
tr	11	But Osiris kept them coming until I quieted down to a chuckle .
tr	10	""" Well , I guess I 'm not as reckless as you are . """
tr	11	He didn 't know what to think about that .
tr	5	""" Yeah , well , parents aren 't guaranteed . """
tr	10	""" I can see the bonfire , "" Melanie stated , but she made no move to get up ."
tr	10	""" I 'd bet you a day 's water that they came from home ."
tr	6	On the first day , he cried -- but this was not uncommon .
tr	6	' Look , I wouldn 't go that far .

tr	8	The insistent buzzing of the intercom on her bedside table brought Jen out of her sleep .
tr	8	""" Of course , dear fellow , "" Virgil said , sloshing liquid into his own glass ."
tr	10	I would have done nothing different with one of my own .
tr	6	With these thoughts , he walked the short distance from the Palace to the Tower .
tr	10	Old Claw might have an idea how to unlock the script .
tr	9	They nodded and he counted down with three of his fingers .
tr	7	Its long arms stretched out and plucked the screaming man up and lifted him up to its mouth .
tr	11	That 's all you have to say ?
tr	5	""" Was it ... "" she stopped herself ."
tr	6	The last known location of the Black Fossil was in Central Europe sometime .
tr	9	He turned away , surveying the place for any probable danger .
tr	7	Then they heard movement to their right and the RPD opened up again .
tr	9	When Gabe speaks again , his voice is so low I almost miss his words .
tr	8	There was nothing for us to say .
tr	8	""" Yes that 's true ; at least it has been till now . """
tr	8	Your father chose it on his name day , when he turned eighteen .

tr	7	Then he looked down and watched his chest wounds silently heal .
tr	9	""" Just needed to talk to a friend . """
tr	11	They reached an opening where several huts stood close by with a larger one in the middle .
tr	8	"His playing became less zealous , and more frazzled , when suddenly , "" POP ! """
tr	10	As he started to climb the ridge , the motor sounds stopped .
tr	10	You have to keep pressing on .
tr	11	I think we all need some rest , probably Mike more than anyone .

tr	10	He cleared his throat , and Zoe braced for the rebut she expected .
tr	7	"Now he is all wrapped up like a present . """

tr	9	She flicks her wrist , sending out just the slightest tinge of energy .
tr	10	Then there were teammates that retaliated for a team member .
tr	11	Although plans were hush hush so as not to arouse more scavenging , Lucas himself was in the loop .
tr	9	It looks clean , about 300 yards in front of your crater .
tr	8	"You can learn how everything works . """
tr	9	He watched the fiery trail run slowly up the dune .
tr	6	""" And when did you see him last ? """
tr	11	She used the time for trying on different clothes for this .
tr	7	She caught her breath , then slid from the bed and made her way to the bathroom .
tr	10	""" It looks like this morning he sent you out to get eaten ."
tr	6	I 'm not antisocial ; I rather enjoy a stimulating conversation .
tr	9	What it all comes down to is that they 're stupid , and we 're not .
tr	11	He touched Taylor 's shoulder to let him know that he was ready .
tr	11	""" I 'd say you have it figured out just fine . """
tr	5	First a very loud , keening , almost static like sound filled the air .
tr	6	"Bloody Japanese , "" he muttered under his breath through clenched teeth ."
tr	7	The boy drew back slowly with Stephanie and the former cardinal took painful steps towards them both .
tr	9	""" Well don 't get used to the idea , "" said David , "" it won 't last too long ."

tr	6	' I need some passports for him , amongst other things . '
tr	11	Reggie couldn 't get a feel for the number of people there , but it seemed to be rather large .
tr	11	The barrier sensed no dark presence on the creature that it let the bird passed through .
tr	8	No one asked about that and Des checked his watch and suggested the band head to makeup .
tr	9	Snow Job was wondering aloud as much as he was asking .
tr	11	"I 'd like to address everyone in town if I could . """
tr	9	""" Doctor , how are you feeling ? """
tr	5	"You , Rhys , Galen , Frost , and who ? """
tr	9	"And if they don 't , I 've fielded a dozen other requests , with more coming in daily . """
tr	7	""" You are a king , and a proud , noble beast . """
tr	7	And then a stupid looking boy sheepishly walked across the space and sat next to the skinny woman .
tr	11	""" Is that my hairbrush you 're using ? """
tr	6	"She gave a tremulous heartfelt smile , "" Merci , Monsieur . """
tr	5	"In difficult times , in dark times , some people shine . """
tr	7	Unspoken words filled the silence between us .
tr	9	The jeweller sat down and reached over to his bottle of wine .
tr	7	A dark emanation flowed out of it : malice , anger , bitterness .
tr	11	By late afternoon the sun began to slip behind the mountains as they days grew shorter .
tr	8	Already descending at the halfway mark , he hears Mai call out to him .
tr	7	""" What 's going on ? """
tr	5	And Rhi 's panic and anger together were not a good thing .
tr	9	There was a large , black , metal cylinder on the south side of the garage .
tr	8	And then the cousins heard a language very similar to their own Bulgarian .
tr	6	""" Those puffy little clouds coming up there , "" Marie starts a sentence , and trails off ."
tr	7	A moment ago the place was miles and miles off , now it 's almost in my face .
tr	11	For endless seconds he remained silent until he felt Adele 's soft hand cover his own .
tr	5	"At the Heaps Open , "" Marcia told the black Heap door ."
tr	5	Brown hair , brown eyes , medium looks , medium height , medium build .
tr	7	I understand it now , but as a baby , it was beyond my comprehension .
tr	5	Arcadia 's receptionist was a bright woman , always smiling .
tr	5	""" You remember him then ? """
tr	6	He caught my wrist inches from his belly .
tr	6	He switched off the motor and got out .
tr	11	""" I 've grown used to not feeling lonely . """
tr	6	Even back in the golden time , dragons vied for power against the different races .

tr	10	"Course by then , the crew had taken the ship an ' Sykes was the new captain . """
tr	7	""" I don 't like this place , "" he asserts , shuddering briefly ."

tr	9	Then I used the diner 's toilets to freshen up .
tr	8	"Honey , what 's wrong , are you ok ? """
tr	5	' Hello , Mikael , ' I said coldly .
tr	10	They stumbled and felt their way around the corner then flattened themselves against the rock wall and waited .
tr	10	Sighing at the meager proposal , Link decides they are wasting time with such childish endeavors .
tr	6	It was all just a bubble , a dome , a fake and a fraud .
tr	8	"In a manner of speaking , this burden , and my life , have been chosen for me . """
tr	6	' So it seems , ' said Faramir , slowly and very softly , with a strange smile .
tr	9	There was more to the Tate person than the awful destructiveness of her weapon , he was sure .
tr	8	""" You can wait 20 seconds , "" she replied , dragging him by the hand through the kitchen ."
tr	9	""" You were telling the truth , "" the Prince said blankly , "" they were trying to kill me . """
tr	9	He seemed to be enjoying this .
tr	10	How stupid could she be that she had believed his lies !

tr	11	It didn 't take long for my imagination to kick in .
tr	10	The other was someone she loved named Scott .

tr	9	He could feel the dogs ' attention riveted on the door .
tr	11	"It is now clear to me that the goal was to abduct the representative . """
tr	8	Wounded Eagle saw this , and his heart began to jump .
tr	10	Amy glanced towards her flatmates and smiled at Calvin who watched .
tr	9	OK this is getting out of hand for a simple case of mistaken identity .

tr	7	""" I 'm going straight to the Roman Empire ! """
tr	6	As they climbed , the tree swayed back and forth from their weight .
tr	7	I am happy for you both , honestly .
tr	8	Ellen opened the driver 's door and looked inside ; the keys were in the ignition .
tr	9	Maybe we would 've dated and gone to the movies or for ice cream .
tr	9	The laughter was directed at Mr. Fleece Hat instead of me now .
tr	7	"And ... they know where all your families live . """
tr	7	I twisted at my torso , back and forth , and there was no longer any pain .
tr	8	""" I 've heard of the Anasazi , "" Jan brightened ."
tr	8	Charlie said , as he gave the jeweller a vicious shake .
tr	7	""" Let 's get out of here quick , I will explain everything on the way . """
tr	6	It became flat and monotone , void of any feeling or emotion .
tr	11	He was truly sober for once which was rather surprising .
tr	10	Red Talon was anxious to get back and to see Three Baskets .
tr	9	""" Rumors are elves still do ."
tr	6	He rubbed the red marks on his wrists from the ties .
tr	9	The shapeshifter walked to the rear of the small two-door , and opened the trunk .
tr	9	The display was of the administrative receptionist 's area from 007 's perspective .
tr	10	It seemed to him that he stood there an eternity , and in truth his wait was rather lengthy .
tr	9	But you didn 't know that for sure , did you ?
tr	10	She was trying to be quiet , but cooking with heavy metal pans over the fire simply wasn 't quiet .
tr	8	And that meant clearing out of the city .

tr	10	It was the generally accepted way of things and now was no time to start experimenting .
tr	10	I 'd love to have smashed his face in .
tr	11	She hesitated a second , wondering it was the proper time , and then finally spoke her mind .
tr	9	No smoke from the chimney and it was certainly cold enough to warrant a fire .
tr	11	It was going to be a hell of a fight .
tr	6	All seventy-five of his fired shots had found their target .
tr	11	There 's something I need to do .
tr	9	""" I understand what you are saying , but I am not sure where we are headed ."

tr	8	""" We have now achieved one reentry from 300,000 feet ."
tr	8	He bandaged them with strips of his shirt under much protest from her .
tr	6	I returned the nod , threw my ceremonial robe off , and raised my staff .
tr	8	If this was an alien ship , and the war was real , he would be under attack by now .
tr	8	David asked , looking about the store .
tr	9	As he opened one of the huge doors , Neil nearly tripped over Riki .
tr	9	""" Hurry , Toby , "" called Victoria , "" we need to leave soon . """
tr	8	I slipped coming down the fire escape and twisted my ankle a little .

tr	7	His heart was still racing , but he was on his way to a normal condition .

tr	6	Lilly Ann interrupted him with an impatient gesture .

tr	8	The darkness ahead grew lighter , distracting me from my grim reflections .
tr	8	"But I 'm here on Elder Crane 's orders , so I need something now ! """

tr	11	Hi Josh , lovely to hear from you .

tr	10	George took a number of shots , from different angles and a close up of the tattoos .
tr	11	' We 'll give ' em a sec to warm up . '
tr	7	Light and the sound of laughter and music spilled through the door .
tr	9	Well , he probably was a security guard , dressed in dark colors and wearing sunglasses .
tr	8	What will happen to her ?
tr	10	And for him the biggest punishment of all was to be barred from his computer .
tr	11	' These look like they 'd get turned away from McDonalds . '

tr	8	I moved towards the wall , pulling down a forester 's outfit .
tr	7	He slapped Malcolm on the back .
tr	7	They spent every moment together , often very close together , but the affection from a week ago was gone .
tr	11	Friends , at what time she goes to sleep or she wakes up , what movie she watches ... everything .
tr	8	Mike smiled and got one back , so he proceeded with his idea and put an innocent question to him .
tr	5	"Like this place , not like a big city . """
tr	5	In a heartbeat , the earth stilled and the room grew quiet .

tr	5	Kaylin , Mom , Dad , Joey , Tuck , and Sadie .
tr	10	He spun her around to face him , her hands in his .

tr	9	From her lips it had the sound of someone summoning a servant .
tr	9	""" It is an unfortunate truth , but secrets must be kept for the greater good . """
tr	11	I left them alive and that was all they could ask for .
tr	10	""" We 'll start with that as soon as we get home ."

tr	9	Waiters dressed in black and white moved in and out of the café like they were in a choreographed dance .
tr	5	""" And the books are all due back today ."
tr	11	Just like I 'm supposed to be , I 'm going to be polite , she thought .
tr	7	Moments later , we paused in the clearing smoke and observed the still bodies around us .
tr	5	' Miyamoto Musashi was an excellent swords master . '
tr	9	With a deep groan , Alejo shoved his hands in his pockets and began walking towards the house .
tr	9	She definitely didn 't like what she had seen or heard .
tr	8	I glimpsed two figures running towards a dilapidated building off the road .
tr	9	""" Dance with me , "" she whispered in a tone no man could have refused ."
tr	6	Hate him , hate him , hate him .
tr	7	Frank carefully folded his suit and his expensive shoes and put them inside his case .
tr	6	Chapter 7 From all their afternoons and evenings together , Earl knew Dante hated surprises .
tr	8	Sure enough , there were devices planted on this side as well .
tr	8	What 's in my book , I mean .
tr	9	Ben stood up with his arms spread and began waddling towards the fridge again .
tr	6	However , their music festivals were a whole other something else .
tr	6	They walked right up behind Josie with big grins .
tr	10	""" Gentlemen , what is the meaning of your presence here ? """
tr	10	"Dropping through 24,000 feet , and turning base to final , six miles from target , "" Jonesy continued ."
tr	9	I planned on bolting after graduation .
tr	8	"I doubt he forgets anything . """
tr	10	He glanced at the bear to see him watching them .
tr	10	This time , the attackers are making no effort to hide their identity .
tr	9	""" I don 't know , "" Taylor began , but Lilly Ann put his hand on top of her belly ."
tr	10	""" Ya know this whole apartment would fit into my living room back home . """
tr	6	Then I saw it through the falling snow .
tr	9	They also realized again that something , or someone , was so obviously directing this man .
tr	6	On the other side was a framed portrait of a handsome middle-aged woman .
tr	7	Eda 's muffled sobbing broke in on her inner musings , and she sank to the ground .
tr	7	' I don 't know the answer to that either . '
tr	9	A glance at the floor revealed the source of the ungodly stink .
tr	5	Her pale feet kick back and forth .
tr	7	The report of the pistol , going off inside the cockpit , was deafening .
tr	10	He said , ' We 've been performing hours every day .
tr	10	She couldn 't see the driver but knew it must be Brian .
tr	9	""" Did they say what they were looking for ? """
tr	9	"Speed Mach 19.5 , altitude 300,000 feet , computer says we are flying straight and level . """
tr	6	Facing the audience all but the first song 's initial chords left Calvin 's memory .
tr	11	You need to get this information to Amanda Carter in London .
tr	7	By the time I pulled my arm from my face , a single shining face was staring back out at me .
tr	10	He ended the call and just sat enjoying a few moments of quiet peace in the empty office .
tr	8	Jakarta 's claiming some sort of massacre ... ... a little further south I think ... .
tr	11	They 'll know we ran -- or at least -- they 'll know I ran .
tr	9	Standing beside the boy with her chin resting on her fist , she stares at the doors thoughtfully .
tr	9	""" You know , I haven 't been to a ball for nearly a decade , "" spoke Jacob ."
tr	8	I could feel the question in the air .
tr	7	He looked towards them and waved .
tr	7	Alfred sat still , awaiting a reply .
tr	9	But even if possible , would one of his siblings truly move so openly against him ?
tr	7	""" You be careful out there , you hear me ? """
tr	8	Scott looked into the three barrels as he gained a deep frown .
tr	7	Until he had a plan , he would keep his friend safe .
tr	5	My legs tire , my mouth dries , my left side aches , and my head pounds .
tr	6	At least fifty soldiers fired from the weapons pads in this room .
tr	11	There was one more thing I needed to do .
tr	8	""" Did I do something to anger you before ? """
tr	8	Chapter 10 Jen strode through the front door with Vivien close on her heels .
tr	7	His fingers reached for the leather bag looped on a thong around his throat , caressing a hidden shape .
tr	9	"Do you want some ? """
tr	9	' Sorry to hear about your housing problems .
tr	10	Connor didn 't want to talk about Andre any more .
tr	7	""" After Harry left the army he opened a martial arts school here in Gloucester ."
tr	10	' Hi , ' Danny said stunned to see him with Katherine .
tr	9	After the ignominy of last evening , he had no desire to face the world .
tr	5	Then again , people die every day .
tr	10	Is this going where I think it is ?
tr	7	I crawled over to him and gently placed a trembling hand over his quivering arm .
tr	8	I wiggled one of Dad 's fancy devices in the keyhole and the lock popped .
tr	11	He saw her look around quickly as a small frown touched her forehead .
tr	8	""" I 've read much of your work . """
tr	8	If I hadn 't been there at all , this likely wouldn 't have happened .
tr	10	Cassie twists trying to struggle free .
tr	8	We knew it would probably happen .
tr	7	""" Sheena , "" she replied offering her hand ."
tr	7	CHAPTER 36 The Light Elaina frowned at the map as they walked .
tr	10	He sold his first story at age 19 to a fantasy magazine and attended the Odyssey Writing Workshop in 2010 .
tr	11	The two brothers ignored him entirely and sitting down , began to discuss something in low , earnest tones .
tr	7	The upholstered interior of dark blue satin is , here and there , worn down to a blacker , threadbare base .
tr	7	It was still hard after all these years .
tr	9	Again , she found herself in front of a tall , iron door .
tr	6	""" Alejo , I was a loser and a coward ."
tr	8	"Are you coming back now ? """
tr	9	He throws off the fear like a dirty shirt and strides toward the doorway , his fists clenched .
tr	6	This man wasn 't just a passive victim , he was an active outlaw .
tr	5	""" Yes , "" said the mayor slowly ."
tr	6	Along with their staff , the noisy plane held about thirty quiet individuals .
tr	9	His pale green eyes reflected the weak rays of the early morning sun , glazed , vacant , and bleak .
tr	7	He slowed down to almost a walk as he approached .
tr	7	It lent them strength and haste , however , and the Raptor floated away from the bank .
tr	10	The boldest laughingly made good-bye waving motions in the way Dog warriors scorned a beaten enemy .
tr	10	"who 's calling me at this stupid hour it 's my day off , "" she said to the empty room ."
tr	10	""" I am glad the arrow has not dimmed your eyes ."
tr	10	Poltergeist grabbed the box as he was thrown from the crash .
tr	6	After the totally awkward eating experience , we cleaned up the empty containers and cleared up the living room .
tr	10	That would only cause more harm , if harm has indeed befallen him .
tr	9	There were more mysteries to solve , more secrets to uncover .
tr	8	He was moving about somewhat and had probably been there for sometime .
tr	8	"Archie , I mean dad , got a bit of a shock when I turned up . """
tr	6	""" How many men have you killed , boy ? """
tr	6	Gabe looks up at me .
tr	9	""" Ahh , ... and there would be the privilege of regular hot breakfasts ! """
tr	6	""" I can feel it ."
tr	7	""" What did you learn from this paper ? """
tr	9	They cut the throats of the deer to let them bleed .
tr	8	she giggled passing him a towel .
tr	6	They were wet and warm , too wet , too warm , and only growing more so .
tr	9	Chase saw the crowded town of Pendragon but Sofia was not there .
tr	9	Sarah looked back at the cottage and then at the dead puppy on the ground .
tr	7	We 're lucky , in spring and early summer this forest is downright homey .
tr	5	""" What 's up there ? """
tr	6	That shut him up , but not Harley .
tr	6	You were extremely helpful and I appreciate your input and time so much .
tr	9	A few of their bullets grazed the ropes holding him over the water and the rope slowly started to unravel .
tr	10	Mike will tell you more when we have a chance .
tr	8	""" Perfect , "" I remember saying to myself ."
tr	7	From a distance , the noises of industry -- diggers , engine gears and exhaust sputters -- carried to him .
tr	9	He picked up a plate and poised a hand over the plate of sandwiches .
tr	9	He swung his head in the direction of the voices and saw four silhouettes down at the shore .
tr	8	Josie finished a mouthful of food and took a drink .
tr	7	""" It 's just a couple minutes , believe it or not ."
tr	10	I had to be strong , no matter what .
tr	10	""" I 'm smarter than you 'll ever be , "" he states matter-of-factly ."
tr	9	I 'd already checked with the Ministry and got his SAS record ... ... nothing weird there either .
tr	7	He was also the oldest by a year and the thinker .
tr	7	"I just make them work . """
tr	6	"Yes , "" she said , but her upward motion froze and she flung herself backward ."
tr	7	Hot shrapnel and burning fragments shot out from the wreckage and rained down from the sky .
tr	8	""" May I ask you a question , Lilly , "" he eased himself into uncharted waters ."
tr	9	""" He 'll want to help us ."
tr	9	She was determined to get answers .
tr	6	' Two hours at the most , ' Anna replied .
tr	6	One private jet , just for a dog , but then in a way , he was grateful .
tr	10	"he answered and pulled out the digital camera , "" Who wants -- "" "" Oooh , me , me ! """
tr	8	' If you don 't release me right now , the First Council will hear of this ! '
tr	9	He drank down the cool refreshing fluid in mighty gulps , following it with a satisfied belch .
tr	7	"When the leader 's at two hundred feet , the co-pilot asks , "" Do you have visual ? """
tr	5	""" Sure , I got it . """
tr	9	"Such things have happened before in the Judgment of Souls . """
tr	9	The big cargo doors made entry and exit of Taylor 's plane very comfortable .
tr	6	""" That coyote will tear you apart . """
tr	11	I would like to go with you to the station and see Mrs. Jones .
tr	9	""" We could have taken off all our cargo and it would have been easier , "" he said ."
tr	5	In its place crept a cool chill , a restless anger , an annoyance , a fury .
tr	8	""" Tell me about your deal with Alfred . """
tr	6	""" Miracle of modern science , "" he went on ."
tr	7	Col looked at her with pain scoring deep , dark lines across his face .
tr	10	The sheriff almost choked on his coffee when he started to laugh .
tr	10	You 're scared because of what COULD have happened .
tr	11	I didn 't want her to know what I knew .
tr	7	"Sure 'n ye know we miss you . """
tr	10	Will was able to step round it .
tr	7	""" Oh , he doesn 't have one yet , "" Ghost said ."
tr	11	She saw a dainty hand twisted the gem and the vision vanished in nothing .
tr	7	"Let 's see how it goes . """
tr	9	With that she helped herself to a hefty piece of pork and a slice of dark bread .
tr	8	He reached something from his sword -- a beautiful necklace was chained into it .
tr	11	The nervous chatter on the mess deck had centered around the recoil tearing an opening in the hull .
tr	7	The bright smile , the cheerful blue eyes , the quick squeeze of his hand -- they could not bury that .
tr	5	""" That 's all me . """
tr	11	"Believe me when I say she 's no lady . """
tr	5	""" Seen and not heard , "" Sarah gently reminded ."
tr	7	He and Jeff collected the weapons and returned them to their place in the cargo hold .
tr	6	She had long blond hair , yes , but her eyes were dark blue , and her skin was perfectly sun-kissed .
tr	8	This also led to a fruitless outcome and left them feeling frustrated .
tr	9	Chase tried to reach it back but she fell so quickly .
tr	6	"I can 't fix it . """
tr	9	He is going to be fine .
tr	11	Just then they could hear that clanging sound made by the triangle on Mr. Stark 's porch .
tr	7	""" I 'll just wait out here for the Firstborn . """
tr	11	Giving it up , Simon weakly fell into the chair from which he had snatched the dressing gown and looked around .
tr	6	""" Temperate woman , then , "" Hugh said , and gave another low bow ."
tr	6	Her face was rosy , her eyes bright , her pale hair sleek , her smile wide .
tr	7	No one will believe us without Phillip now .
tr	7	He took the man by the hand and put him on his shoulders .
tr	8	""" Let 's get out of here . """
tr	6	On the same wall , but in the opposite corner there was an old mattress without any bed sheets .
tr	7	David looked at the cows , then back at the dog .
tr	9	Pierre and Nora were smitten with each other , walking along the beach just talking about everything , holding hands .
tr	11	Rick decided he had better make quick work of Anna .
tr	8	The cliché was a bit much , but seeing the others around the room , it was true .
tr	10	Aria is unconscious and bleeding all over Jason 's carpet .
tr	8	Several monks , including their leader Abbot Baum , were found guilty by special tribunal and hanged at dawn this morning .
tr	11	"I said , "" I 'll make it as quick as I can . """
tr	6	""" Like I said ... sit down and shut up . """
tr	9	Connor finally asked one of the concierges if he had seen Andre .
tr	6	""" No fear , "" Neil said without hesitation ."
tr	10	You may pretend you are like them .
tr	9	He squatted down in front of the safe and peered inside .
tr	7	Being fed and rested certainly helped .
tr	9	How do you think your food gets cooked ?
tr	9	She is too much of a lady for riff-raff to speak of her in that fashion .
tr	9	The company was off in a sprint as quickly as Clancy cleared his hiding place .
tr	6	""" She was taken , "" Emma said , "" and then we took her back ! """
tr	8	Was a life without him a life without hope ?
tr	6	The fingers on my neck relax .
tr	8	""" I will peel your skin like an apple , and douse your wounds in salt . """
tr	10	He was being pulled in so many directions and couldn 't see a clear path .
tr	8	Dawn was approaching but they all continued to talk and talk .
tr	5	""" I know , "" muttered Dreamer , then her stomach rumbled ."
tr	9	The apartment was empty of everything but the furniture .
tr	11	The Prince cleared his throat , which had a sudden lump in it .
tr	10	Valerian swore softly and tugged vainly , with his legs braced against the chair .
tr	11	"Make your XO aware that he will have the Brigade until you return . """
tr	10	""" You need to study a lot for this "" ."
tr	5	The Captain 's voice ; raised a few degrees above room temperature .
tr	7	The first person she saw was Valerian .
tr	9	He wondered how Sarah 's parents were doing this morning .
tr	10	Have you noticed Dad watched us like a hawk all day today ?
tr	7	You all know that it couldn 't .
tr	8	""" First you eat , then you sleep some more and then we 'll talk about everything ."
tr	7	""" Not much -- sounds thin to me , "" I said , returning his grin ."
tr	11	""" Well , I 'd have to say , a little complicated , "" began Jon ."
tr	10	As they got near the center of the camp , Nathan saw why .
tr	9	Right now they are mainly tooled to produce hunting shotguns .
tr	8	There , standing with teeth clenched , stood Isaac .
tr	9	, kissed me on the cheek and skipped down the road giggling .
tr	10	"To her , he added , "" We 'll talk further when you 're rested . """
tr	9	Most of them seemed to radiate pure hatred and disgust , and the Prince couldn 't understand why .
tr	9	The voices started quietly , melding with the instruments , then pulled them to greater tempo , fiercer emotions .
tr	9	I decided to let her be .
tr	11	Will was trying to make sense of the strange set-up .
tr	8	I smiled to avoid swearing .
tr	8	Blood dripped from the edges of my blades .
tr	11	He reached his posted sentry after less than a full turns walk .
tr	10	""" You keep saying we 're doomed ."
tr	6	Take him to the hospital .
tr	8	All around her , steam rose from patches of muddy water , like a never-ending bog of eternal stench .
tr	10	She took some time to think about it .
tr	10	All they had to do was take their time .
tr	9	He opened his eyes and saw a hawk flying above the trees .
tr	8	You are all heading back to base , Lieutenant .
tr	11	Logan , for his part , threw out his chest , defying the shot about to come .
tr	8	I know that everything 's fine .
tr	8	""" The one you 're chasing is the old kind . """
tr	7	"But only for a second and then switch back to invisible mode . """
tr	8	As he passed us , I smiled sadly , and he offered a bowed head .
tr	6	John spat as his face red face lit up the room .
tr	9	Chase remove the hood of his cloak , revealing more of his eye-catching looks .
tr	9	Zombies in this state can seem to be not very dangerous .
tr	8	Without even thinking the boys threw themselves into the thick of the battle .
tr	8	That 's all I have .
tr	8	""" Of course you do , "" he chuckled as he strode forward ."
tr	5	""" Did , uh , America or Russia fire first ? """
tr	7	Just as he swung it down , I rolled out of the way and landed on the ground hard .
tr	8	' To make it more deadly , ' she stated dully , confirming my suspicion .
tr	8	After a couple more hits the alien inside him gave up ; it had completed its task .
tr	8	the Prince managed to croak out , finally finding his voice .
tr	9	He felt unarmed as he proceeded toward the wood .
tr	7	The pilot pulls his throttle and shoves his control column to one side .
tr	9	The walk would take most of the day now that the ground was wet and muddy .
tr	11	Ted pushed the large double doors apart , holding them so that Melody could slip through .
tr	10	How it felt to touch him .
tr	10	It 'll be easy to sort out .
tr	9	The man obviously thought this a strange question for a major to be asking a captain .
tr	9	It felt good to be back .
tr	7	' You are no relative of mine , half-breed ! '
tr	10	He watched Lilly Ann carefully peel back the plastic lid from the coffee can and pull the aluminum lid open .
tr	10	Dumas himself might have written a novel about us : the three companions strutting off the train into a new city .
tr	9	"I mean , do you have any information ? """
tr	8	But the Audi 's protesting engine hurled the car forward .
tr	6	By the time their bodies struck the forest floor , we were already running .
tr	6	"Every inch of the pasture and meadow must be parasite free . """
tr	8	she claimed as she studied the picture .
tr	9	She wanted to crawl out of herself , to shed an itchy and hated skin .
tr	8	It 's over and that 's the end of it .
tr	10	Grace seemed to fold into a shyness Katherine hadn 't seen in weeks .
tr	6	""" Good morning gentlemen , "" he murmured , stretching ."
tr	10	That was a point that resonated with Lynn .
tr	9	The Turk who was protecting her was evidently not a bad man .
tr	8	The man relaxed as he drained the bottle .
tr	6	One pointed his pistol -- a large one -- and the other kid shot into the air .
tr	5	Now his energy hums , smooth and quiet .
tr	9	He sat across from Nathan and laced his fingers in front of him .
tr	6	""" It tastes good , "" Jack shrugged , "" Starve for all I care ."
tr	9	That friend he was walking around with outside is probably a scab too .
tr	8	"He 's actually AWOL never mind everything else . """
tr	10	Run us onto a sandbar , knockin ' a hole in the hull .
tr	5	""" And g * y guys just watch g * y porn . """
tr	7	They are drawing on my magic .
tr	11	And then this macho man breezed through the entrance , full of swagger , wearing leather pants and sunglasses .
tr	6	The envy inside of me is sudden and sharp .
tr	8	We collapsed like shattered husks about the room .
tr	6	""" The front door 's open , "" she said ."
tr	7	She 's casting for him again .
tr	10	"But ... I got ta ask ... "" Seth was surprised at the hesitation ."
tr	10	""" Forgive me ; to which of your problems do you refer ? """
tr	5	After all this time , he still felt so very good .
tr	11	' What if they don 't sell enough to cover costs ? '
tr	9	The room was brightly painted but quiet , seemingly insulated from the rest of the building .
tr	6	""" Show me , "" he told her ."
tr	11	""" Do you think she 's there ? """
tr	6	Dad nodded to the fridge .
tr	6	""" Nate , "" Bobby said , "" I just cut a guy in half with an antique shotgun ."
tr	11	They were already in line to order when he hung up .
tr	5	""" Close your eyes , "" he says , and I do ."
tr	6	A lonely little smile plays across his lips .
tr	9	He picked out another one but it put it back as well , and he realized that he was bored .
tr	7	He was the proverbial kid before a road trip .
tr	9	The sphere glides away from the remnants of the discharge and toward the massive gas giant Jupiter .
tr	5	""" It 's all right , now , Sam . """
tr	11	We vote on ' When did you stop beating your wife ? '

tr	9	There he rides , bold as he can be , a murder and thief .

tr	9	He never knew he was under attack .
tr	11	Mac stuck his hand in the pool to see what would happen .
tr	9	He sensed Takeo was plotting a major assault .
tr	10	He quit laughing in favor of cursing .
tr	11	"And ... said that they were lucky , "" said Ben improvising on the spot ."

tr	8	Seconds after we started running , flames ignited the liquid trail to the fuel tank .

tr	8	I had trouble addressing the man this way .
tr	11	I can tell you 're new at this .

va	11	"And try to be nice for once . """
va	9	I thought Carlos was overstepping the mark .
va	7	"Everyone knows about the Changing ; grey eyes draw attention . """
va	10	Never would she give him pain or cause to regret that kindness .
va	5	After some minutes , she was weak and powerless again .
va	10	He had no idea what was going on either .
va	8	I have witnessed it with my own eyes , myself and 2 other agents acted to preserve it .
va	8	As the silence lengthened , the Prince once more felt tension creeping into his shoulders and chest .
va	9	Rather than see her , or hear her for that matter , he sensed her presence at his side .
va	8	There wasn 't much time , and he really needed to think .
va	7	One camera crew was there on the far end , no doubt doing a follow-up piece .
va	7	I can 't hear the pumpkin wedges through the permanent brain damage !
va	9	My hands were bleeding with blisters from the shovel .
va	11	""" I think you will find we have every choice . """
va	7	She hasn 't been beaten and behind the scenes , remains in charge .

va	8	Then I brought my left fist into his side with full force , releasing some static charge in the process .
va	7	His breath left his lips in a soft sigh : he nodded with a defeated expression .
va	8	asked Ben , tilting his head toward Mohammed .
va	10	Its large wheels made easy work of the rolling landscape and its solid metal frame appeared impenetrable .
va	10	David spoke as he followed his son from around the house .
va	6	""" Was that a gun ? """
va	6	""" Me and Evil Harry go way back , "" said Cohen , rolling a cigarette ."
va	11	OK , now this part is going to blow you away if you 'll excuse the pun ... ... . .
va	6	' Outside the client 's building , ' he replied .
va	10	Amy looked at Katherine but didn 't move to answer it .
va	11	You 'd think they would clean up for this .
va	8	He announces , quickly beginning his trek toward the treasure .
va	7	With a shudder , I turn away and press my hands down hard against the porch .
va	8	Creep didn 't let it faze him .
va	8	""" Thank you , though I understand his meaning clear enough ."
va	10	""" She never had any intention of killing me you know ."
va	10	He had been well looked after and loved by the Australians he had met .
va	10	A lover of history and fantasy , Michael now writes to show the personal side of the past .
va	9	""" Yes , it is Pedro , and I hope he is still alive ."
va	8	Her heart was thudding against her ribs , but her eyelids drooped .
va	10	Sky ran along the boardwalk through the pine trees and stopped as if she 'd hit glass .
va	9	""" We want to go fishing , "" said Loot ."
va	7	""" We have a killing out at the Belmont Lodge Golf Club ."
va	11	At that moment Michael and Ben appeared and offered to post Ivan 's letter for him .
va	8	Although the station wasn 't far , the roads twisted and turned and were not at all logically organized .
va	7	I stammered dumbly , cowering now .
va	7	""" Targets are on the thirteenth floor , "" A male voice added ."
va	11	He seriously doubted whether he could have lifted it anyway .
va	5	His men , throughout the building , had a similar disheveled appearance .
va	10	Neil rolled into the sea and sank , arms and legs waving in a desperate attempt to stay afloat .
va	6	""" Yes , sir , about that ... "" began Beau ."
va	6	The new Kyle had spindly arms and legs , a long , narrow nose , and bluish skin .
va	5	The good , the bad , the beautiful , the ugly , the pleasure , the pain .

va	5	"Or maybe , ' drugs are never good entertainment , right ? ' """
va	7	""" All right , sounds like a plan , "" Bradley agreed , hearing the noise up above ."
va	10	With the strap wrapping around the leg , he pulled hard to tighten the cloth band around the skin .
va	7	Then , in the all but silent room , a slight rumble came from beneath the ship .
va	9	He flicked through the contents pages until he found a reference for Osaka .
va	7	The Asian on the left , the smaller of the two , in the designer suit , was talking .

va	10	Chapter 13 : John Kisses Good The next morning Lilly Ann was in especially high spirits .
va	7	After a few moments of frenzied side discussion and shouted argument , Jess reigned in the chaos .
va	10	That was a part of her that didn 't surprise him at all .
va	10	It could be the most important journey he had ever undertaken .
va	9	""" I have most of your things unpacked , and I 've had a bath poured ."
va	7	""" May the Truth go beside you and Peace watch your door . """
va	6	Silence clots up the air , and , in my experience , that 's never a good sign .

va	7	As a matter of fact , much of it is based on the Constitution .
va	7	Just then a shadowy flutter of white came along the bushes and stopped beside the bear .

va	7	yelled Tommy snapping Ricky back by the shirt collar and throwing him to the ground .
va	8	Maria took Connor by the hand and walked right past him toward the glass elevator .
va	7	His voice was nothing but a hoarse whisper .

va	9	He scrolls through his HUD and finds the channel he needs .
va	8	"And Anna , set up the DVD for us , OK ? """

va	9	Come to think of it , why would she be so sad ?

va	11	Kayla , of course , used this time to get to him , I thought .
va	7	Then the big one showed up -- the leader of the pack .

va	7	Then , after a while , he walked along with me , imitating my gait .
va	9	It was starting to cloud over .

va	7	This could only mean one thing - the Angel was somewhere near .

te	10	With that she fades away , the grin on the boy 's face certain to remain for quite a while .
te	8	He grabbed both and yanked her off the bed and put her on her feet .
te	5	""" There we go , "" he says ."
te	7	Though the majority featured Danny , one of Calvin made a fantastic action shot .

te	7	She is worthy of the chance to excel .

te	9	Damn : A sick child is all I need .
te	11	Kevin and Keno zigzagged until they rounded the last bend and opened up speed on the wide straightaway .

te	8	The girls , Melanie and Tara , kept smiling over at Dave and Rob throughout dinner .
te	8	She sighted across the top of one .
te	5	And this time , the crazed bitch almost sang that question .
te	6	And in that moment , I felt all my sadness , all my separation from those around me .
te	6	A strange look crossed his face , a flicker of hurt and worry flashed through his eyes .
te	8	As each woman set foot over the threshold she stared and glared wildly about her .
te	8	That unfinished web shifted back into a weapon of Fire and Air .
te	9	The bullet travelled through the various layers of clothing never finding any skin tissue .
te	7	With a tinge of sadness , he stepped away from the wreck and turned toward the barking dog .
te	10	I put a finger to my cheek and feel the imprint of the carpet fibers on my skin .
te	6	His voice cracked a little , and Alejo felt his shoulders tense .
te	7	But the voice did not sound like a man 's .
te	11	He 'll progress quicker if he 's not dealing with emotions and relationship issues .
te	11	That 's all she wanted to know .
te	9	She pulled the covers back to jump up and amend the oversight when he stopped her .
te	6	""" Let 's hurry , "" he whispered ."
te	10	He hummed to his master to calm his nerves .

te	10	He made a mental note to be nice to her later .
te	9	My body shivered as my wet clothes pressed against my skin .
te	9	It was going to be a hoot .
te	9	Let 's see how this plays out until tomorrow .

te	6	The Bastian leader nodded his acquiescence at our questioning gazes .
te	8	he murmured into the mouthpiece of his microphone .
te	8	The receptacle begins to rise , lifting Lance off his feet .
te	8	Noah had to be just fine .
te	10	He then began to look at the new and emerging internet .
te	7	Brazen could probably understand why .
te	7	He nodded and the man poured a full glass , set the bottle down and stepped back .
te	8	Jeremy had helped Chris along , every step of the way .
