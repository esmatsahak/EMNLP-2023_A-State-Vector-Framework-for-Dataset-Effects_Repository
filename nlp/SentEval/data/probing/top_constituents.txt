tr	S_CC_S_.	I won 't let him or anyone stand in my way again .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I slowly looked up , from the Nike air shoes rising to his denim jeans topping off with fit gray t-shirt .
tr	VP_.	""" For me , too ."
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he was serious .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could we possibly do this ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they were all rogues .
tr	NP_PP_.	All four of us this time .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Together they walked the length of the yard , surveying the Bermuda and stopping under the two large oaks .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so he turned to eavesdropping , and had much better luck in doing this .
tr	OTHER	And that they wanted it more than they wanted anything else .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then you and Mary abduct a child .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Then all kinds of bells and whistle went on in a data screen that was close to them .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Only until I phone you and tell you the situation is normal again .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much wasted time .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I kick your chair or breathe too heavily ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he mocking her ?
tr	VP_.	Stare into my hands .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean she wanted him to stay the night , as well ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What hurt most was that Scott had asked his sister to break the news .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Another thing he 'd been good for besides sex .
tr	NP_VP_.	Lois didn 't regret quitting her job .
tr	S_VP_.	Changing the subject seems like the right course to take .
tr	NP_PP_.	A honeymoon in Vegas ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As Reggie and I got up to leave Griffin turned to me .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet Will seemed to take it in stride .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	By the time he began to add a variety of regional accents to the empty discussions he had long since stopped worrying about it .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he wilted those tender feelings as quickly as if he 'd pulled the plug on the lamp .
tr	VP_.	Cheering my head off .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why should she run ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I could I 'd destroy the True Faith church with my bare hands .
tr	VP_.	Take the day off .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though I have convinced a couple of my siblings that Genesis is allegory ( small victories ) .
tr	S_VP_.	To make it go away , to wrap him up in total safety .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he meant to continue to do so should Gregori be unable to rid his body of the hideous toxins .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he forget Star hates boys or something ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was it that he caused her unusual constraint now ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But right here and right now she felt that she could take anything on .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe she 'd just seen someone who looked like Jax .
tr	OTHER	Will this great miracle happening at this moment separate time once again ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her eyes snapped back to his face and she was back to glaring .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Noah immediately tried to call the number back .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was I supposed to do ?
tr	VP_.	Broke the harmonious flow of simple melody .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment afterward there was complete silence .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If they truly see me they say not a word .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Sage 's sister had picked this dress out for Colleen and she 'd worn it the night Sage had first noticed her .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Within seconds the roof of the tunnel started to crumble , until enough debris had fallen to cover most of the body and completely block the tunnel .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the very centre pages was something strange .
tr	VP_.	Caught us by surprise , actually .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He simply couldn 't say no .
tr	NP_PP_.	The hollow , disconnected feeling inside her .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the boyfriend had money and power , probably kept a few officials in his pocket .
tr	OTHER	Could she be jealous ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That I could remember them all , even the men I 'd first murdered so long ago , amazed me .
tr	NP_VP_.	There is nothing he can do to you .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By the time I was done Tye and Paul would be dead .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" One victim at a time ."
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I just say that ?
tr	OTHER	Isn 't that what we all want in the end ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Together they fell , weightless , into the night .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I had no choice .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Good luck with that ."
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it struck inland , somewhere beyond the marshes .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we set off again , climbing upwards and onwards , towards the gnomes and our own deaths .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Warren pulls his head back and his pupils , wide and open , glare into Steve 's eyes .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Who 's gon na watch your back if your ' specialists ' turn on you or on each other .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I really thinking about them procreating ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he stood to open fire , literally , on the ones who 'd almost killed her .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like I ceased to exist when she left .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His eyes closed and his face wore an expression of sheer bliss as she rode him .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When she looked about thirty seconds from heading out the front door with Colt Mason wasn 't the time to be making jokes .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But even the Governor favored open trade with Holland , realizing the benefits for the citizens of his colony .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Yet I couldn 't assent too quickly .
tr	NP_PP_.	The club owner from last night .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where was Dan now ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it 's that my lady parts are on high alert since our texts yesterday .
tr	S_VP_.	Moving as fast as lightning and waving to him was Isla .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For some reason it was the sight of my empty bike stand hanging from the ceiling that , after everything , made me cry .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How would she have the willpower to resist that , as beaten down as she 'd been feeling ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he told me that maybe they didn 't do that Presidents ' Day stuff anymore .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He lovingly smiled back at me , and then stood up straight and took my hand .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	About this time James Dean and Rufus were approaching the counter .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What made her and her sisters and her father happy would make him happy .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you leave with him ?
tr	NP_VP_.	They headed towards the Priory .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did that mean ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The flames danced around him as he thrashed about , the tendrils licking the ceiling .
tr	S_VP_.	To leave a vampire in the hands of the Shields was torture , excruciating pain , guaranteed .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And still I swam , keeping the image of the medallion firmly in my thoughts .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How the green and the gold flecks lit her eyes , as bright and dark as she was .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I want to date ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Come the weekend we lost control of our ability to act like rational human beings , oftentimes nearly killing ourselves during our extracurricular exploits .
tr	S_VP_.	Searing fog flared around her .
tr	NP_VP_.	It flooded into her veins , so comforting that it shook her to her core .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Another crush she had wanted to sit down with her .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would they find when they got there ?
tr	OTHER	A million times worse .
tr	NP_VP_.	The theater is my life .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she 'd been right .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What does it mean ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Not if it meant I was going to lose Lucky .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I heard it .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Whatever premonitions I 'd had about Jude and heartbreak going hand in hand flew out the window .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But perhaps she is yours ?
tr	OTHER	Stronger and able to take on all the things that waited for her .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The flames were so close to me I could feel the heat !
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	More than she 'd ever know .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Under the table she cursed the day she 'd met Danny .
tr	VP_.	Call me at that number Thursday night at nine from the pay phone next to the men 's rest room in Houston 's on Poplar .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Those same friends who may or may not know me would never guess what I had planned for today but it all had been planned .
tr	OTHER	He and I both had issues .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she wants to gloat ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a big man he moved surprisingly lightly .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night she made a dry camp , ate her meal and tumbled into an exhausted sleep .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I 'll just stay away for a few hours .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did I care ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Two of our teams were terminated by Russian gangs and we have not retaliated as yet .
tr	NP_VP_.	I 'd run until I buried the horror .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is he doing ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it was that the art of resurrection , which should have remained in its place of memory and legend , was brought back into action .
tr	NP_PP_.	Still no attack of spinach ?
tr	S_VP_.	Finding his ex-wife murdered in the road had understandably shocked him , upset him , even though he hadn 't been in love with her .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because if you trusted me there would be nothing to be upset about with Ayden .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did the trees on the ceiling and the stars on the floor have to do with the riddle ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	"He finished rather ruefully , "" they are both convinced this is a city of demons and their worshippers ."
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes words that people use have different meanings in different ages .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The one he 'd taken away that first night .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know the garnet was reported to aid in the connection of our conscious mind and our unconscious ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What were you thinking of ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he is still looking at me that way .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	"He then whispered to Prentice , "" It looks like a gun ."
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If they did not do this , then neither would they recognize the need for Oneness among the kelp .
tr	OTHER	Just who do you think you are ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Bad decision on my part !
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though I didn 't mean to mess up your Christmas day with your family .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he 'd start typing replies on a typewriter his parents had purchased him for his ninth birthday .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then Jacques had always been a jerk .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that 's my target : four years .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	No doubt she moved as best as she could , though , perhaps hoping for reunion ; or at the very least , explanation .
tr	OTHER	And thanks again for letting me stay here .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she accept Egwene herself ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he want me to be the class slut ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He could hardly move .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they have another purpose and the fish came in as time allowed it to go wild ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From somewhere up the river another gun boomed .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But sometimes the shuttle Pioneer found something .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had this man even managed to sneak into Christine 's room ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe I did mean it that way .
tr	OTHER	Can 't you see it 's different ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If anyone could have seen us at that moment I believe he would have thought we were two enemies met for a battle to the death .
tr	S_VP_.	Playing alone always helped to soothe her nerves .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she did what Mommy always did when she passed some of the witches .
tr	NP_VP_.	A hard smile touched his mouth .
tr	OTHER	Wasn 't he full of questions ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	"They all greeted him back with smiles and "" Good mornings "" of their own ."
tr	S_CC_S_.	His hands creeped back down and suddenly , he was tickling me .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What do you think ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I do something ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If this was right then her father was actually seven years older than he said he was .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It had been a rough night and he was sore in places he 'd never been sore .
tr	VP_.	Taken from her family to a far off city , to live alone without others of her age ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She stopped shrinking , holding onto the tree just below the nook entrance .
tr	OTHER	Are you hiding something from them ?
tr	VP_.	Give her some aspirin and put her to bed .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What made the entire situation even worse was the desire flowing through her at his touch .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it hit her .
tr	OTHER	Are you leaving town ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	This continued until both Carlos and I felt sufficiently uncomfortable .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She also knew exactly what had happened when Jo answered my phone and how it would never happen again .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But even here I couldn 't get away from the statues .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I told her about your General Store and the fire and she wants to do a follow-up story .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	"Often the only "" offence "" that had been committed was one that the State had decided was anti social ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she set aside her drink , then stood and walked through the gateway , her diaphanous pale blue gown shimmering with golden embroidery .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	This could have been an island the way the weather would change .
tr	NP_PP_.	Those sorts of problems .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I also want men to remember me .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the world is brutal .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The ones I want to forget .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Eleanor keeps reminding me .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever had opened fire on them had retreated by now .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Apparently it was too much to hope for that he 'd forget about invading my privacy like that .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she sat there , crossing her arms across her chest and glaring right back at him .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Hopefully he wouldn 't call my bluff .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if they don 't see each other enough as it is .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For a man is not merely who he is , but what he has .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	After he 'd drugged her .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it won 't all be bad .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I 'll pick myself up , write a new resume , find another night job , and get back out there .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	There it is , out in the open .
tr	VP_.	cried a bubbly voice .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she think he wouldn 't remember it ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I stepped around him and picked up my pace .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I know it 's a crazy story .
tr	OTHER	Are you still going out with Tyler tonight ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	After they 'd gone Rachel snickered a little and elbowed Dan who was sitting relatively close next to her .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	KT screamed then made a very short prayer to the Goddess asking for more forward velocity .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I inwardly groaned because just the thought of her made my heart pound and crave for her blood .
tr	S_VP_.	Knowing this could be the last time he ever saw her made him want to say something to change her mind .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now it turns the magnet on , instead of off .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Within moments Jason rode out of the trees and waved his arms at the distant rider .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Allie 's eyes did not grow wide with cosmic wonder .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he was delighted when at last he managed to make one secure enough to hold back the flow and form a decent miniature lake .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How else could he be sure his blocking device was effective ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whether she was or wasn 't was beside the point .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The one he used to seduce and devour her .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although , with what Sawyer had confessed to me tonight , my virtue would be the only one left in the house .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she already married to someone else ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her twists , which she 'd gotten redone for the wedding , were hanging down and she was dressed in jeans and a simple sweater .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did he manage to turn her insides to goo ?
tr	VP_.	said the Senior Wrangler .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the spacecraft were first identified there was no attempt at warning the citizenry for fear of global panic .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who cared what people thought of her ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Through the metal door and down the steps into the medical facility , where I looked down and saw the loop sticking out beside my boot .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Just close enough for her to know it was there .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I sat in my car and cried and cried .
tr	S_VP_.	Just being there with him felt wrong .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before I headed upstairs to shower I built a fire in my fireplace which could also be seen on the Web cam .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Or she might have reproached him for sleeping , or sleeping so soundly , that someone had managed to spirit it away .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	All about him he saw heartless faces of the village , eyes staring a hole through him .
tr	NP_VP_.	Gracie woke , shaking .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that was it .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He might be right about Kim but she refused to admit it to him .
tr	OTHER	He smelled deeply at her hair and then he kissed her again .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Whenever he tried to get up she yanked a little harder on the strap until he returned to all fours .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That she was not somehow caught up in the oddity that was this town .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now she was refilling all the olive oil decanters .
tr	OTHER	Would this knowledge have made her smile more frequently as she was smiling now ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if the school colors splashed across the sky would send us running to the ticket booth .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Which I guess was why it surprised me when he introduced us to Fiona .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she think he was made of steel ?
tr	VP_.	wish he wouldn 't treat people like playthings .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	"He heavily emphasized "" busy schedule , "" questioning the validity of her words ."
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I couldn 't stop myself .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was I trapped here like this ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just gave her a sweet smile and shut the door behind her .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Was there anything she could do to change his mind ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How alone he must have felt as he went from home to home , always as an outsider .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She was a vampire and yet she was talking about dressing like a vampire for Halloween .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Gently he lifted my leg , sliding both hands down from my knee to my foot , slowly .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I run out of the room .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because he couldn 't abandon them , or Emma and Max would face the threat of Manuel alone .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she spied him , threading his way through the throng .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then you had the terriers that spilled around our ankles .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did that mean ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I had spent two years looking for them and another year drifting aimlessly , because I didn 't know what to do with myself .
tr	VP_.	came a startled voice from the other side .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He was overjoyed at his luck but that quickly faded when he realized that he was in the Citadel prison .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even with a scowl she was the most beautiful girl in the kingdom .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We only stopped dancing to eat and to happily head back to our room .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Almost at once a man emerged from the house .
tr	VP_.	Looking for incoming fire .
tr	VP_.	Leave the rest with the cooks .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she really like Mike ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did her face just get hot ?
tr	VP_.	Feed good to dragon .
tr	NP_VP_.	That made up for the days of boredom at the office .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he had to have had some practice .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are restored muscle cars magnets for cops and tickets anyway ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now the high hedges of the Italian garden had formed a maze , a twisted one from which there was clearly no escape .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I took off up the hill at the fastest pace I thought I could hold .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she hurt you ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because I really did want her to live her life , even if that meant moving on from me .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he doing here ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Looking at the clock she saw she 'd missed lunch .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was the matter with her ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe Aunt Petal had the right of it .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he found petrified him .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If the Tribunal didn 't decide to lock her away .
tr	OTHER	Now go light the oil as I instructed .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he was finding so intriguing was beyond me ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He saw her tattoo and the Stone and the faces of some people he did not recognize .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Before I can ask if everything is alright , the bell rings to switch classes and he is quickly out the door without even a backward glance .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she 'd noticed his backing off .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where the hell was Nick ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the girl got herself the reasoning in her mind to lunge the beauty on four legs and realized she could move .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When Jane returned we sat in virtual silence , with only the sound of the hum in the basement to break the monotony .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps they would have .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she did the same .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But other than that , everything feels normal .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The door to his office opened and Beverly 's fluffy blonde head popped around the corner .
tr	NP_PP_.	The model of virtue that women from her time tried to emulate their whole lives .
tr	S_VP_.	Just throw it in your golf bag and someone will pick it up from you tonight .
tr	S_CC_S_.	A few minutes later her doorbell rang again and another messenger delivered a large black-and-white box .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she hadn 't expected was to find it completely occupied by females .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He reached to touch her hair , gently sliding his hand over the long tresses in a way he hadn 't had the chance to before .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once the ice had been broken Janice offered to make him a cup of tea .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I notice my body .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She glared at me and I returned her twice as that .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knows what I would have caught .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he wander after not making it to the major leagues ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she wasn 't sure they 'd believe her .
tr	NP_PP_.	Right in this room .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"If something doesn 't change ... "" I shrugged ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the end I made up my mind not to feed at all , and die .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why take a suicide so close to heart ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	The first ranks broke apart and the swordsmen charged forth , led by Herr 'D on and his fanatical rage .
tr	NP_PP_.	An understanding between old rivals .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because the Royals are the example everyone follows ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Wanted to see what else I could do to him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I headed in that direction , careful to keep out of sight of the giants roaming the hallways .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And most likely she 's right .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he keeping me in suspense on purpose ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there was his arm - the pain that seemed to disappear overnight .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it would be Jonesy 's job to match her tumbling , and gently bring the craft down to where he thought was the best landing site .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I held on to that rational part of Clayton Reed who recognized the futility of my anger and panic .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the idea is not without precedent .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her thoughts were stunted as the door opened and Keno walked in with a tray with hot tea and small cups .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Which was a pleasant change from the pained face he had worn throughout the last part of the trip here .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	As soon as the door opened Sadie greeted us .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A month later he was on his way to the post office in Pittston on cold , cloudy day .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All last week they said that meteor would be no problem .
tr	NP_VP_.	She closed her eyes and pushed herself against his mouth .
tr	NP_PP_.	One of my former coworkers .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What in the hell was her father thinking ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All night her dreams had been filled with potential disasters .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Made me realize I wasn 't personally essential to their plans .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who else is there ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the leasing agency called me .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it was the Death Watchmen themselves who 'd received the orders .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He couldn 't keep his hands off her and they settled at her waist .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Which meant whatever was wrong must be bad enough to take a bite out of his sense of humor .
tr	VP_.	asked my pa when we drove up without it .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For some reason he couldn 't wake up even though he knew the gates were slowly closing .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would he do that ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Fade was referring to his harsh words on my naming day , when he 'd told me everything was over between us .
tr	VP_.	said Stanley wearily , itching to get off to the Rat Office and see what his next job was .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he got that even though she hadn 't seen her sister in six years , April meant just as much to Dianna .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then an idea hit him .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I mention the muscles ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And at least it wasn 't raining .
tr	NP_PP_.	One of his only reminders of a world that once was .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How 'd he missed this softer , more idealistic side to her ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I tucked my knife back up my sleeve , crossed my arms over my chest , and leaned one hip against the bar .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he licks the seam of my mouth and the minute his tongue touches me , my lips part .
tr	NP_VP_.	She prayed she looked a lot more menacing than she felt .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last night they had just been areas of burned skin .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he was a curse .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With my head buried in the cushions I hear the sounds of his clothes falling away .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He then shook the feeling away .
tr	VP_.	Tell Proserpine I 've paid my debts to her .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he didn 't .
tr	NP_VP_.	He grabbed Jake by the shoulders and steadied him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The words just wouldn 't come .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	"After "" investigating "" a few respectable gentlemen at some of the finer establishments in the city I found him ."
tr	S_VP_.	Turns out the city of Fullerton had a bona fide serial killer .
tr	S_VP_.	Hanging from the ceiling was the source of the wonderful smell .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I had been taken by storm ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did the cat drag in this time ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She looked at her watch .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then Alix realized they 'd never taken the time to be more than roommates .
tr	S_VP_.	Used to be I never got a moment 's piece .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely he 'd realized this before ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her fiery red hair was in tight curls and she had a scowl on her face that you could see for miles .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I then slid it back beside my tray .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only the Stone 's light shows it .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course he 'd see the sky again .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where could he do the most good ?
tr	OTHER	There 's a short puff of smoke and then they hang dormant .
tr	VP_.	Don 't rush into anything .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Once more his mind ventured out .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	After he had seen that Mr. Baggins ' one idea was to get away .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why don 't we switch topics for now .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If he has a weakness it 's his superstitions , his worrying about bad luck .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We fiends are strengthened by our unjust fate , while angels morally degenerate .
tr	VP_.	Topped off the mag for his Desert Eagle .
tr	OTHER	At least during the day she was safe from Madeline .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he just needed some possessions .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The ones she 'd remember long from now , during the endless winter nights when she was alone and lonely .
tr	NP_VP_.	He edges the seat towards me .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I realize that my eyesight becomes better looking at you .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That her father was willing to give everything he owned to his enemy rather than his own children was too humiliating to share .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once he discovered she had a daughter he conspired to have her kidnapped and murdered on camera .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She was a sensual woman and he loved it , that she responded to all kinds of touch and stimulation .
tr	VP_.	Don 't do it for your sister .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he capable of committing such a heinous crime not once , but twice ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she drew in her breath and let it out on a sigh .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was strange walking along the old road , seeing the foundations of the buildings he used to know so well .
tr	NP_VP_.	I want Savannah trained as a jockey .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can I trust anything you say to me ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Once again I lost control of my body .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the first five minutes neither of us said a word to each other .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The attack soon fell apart and the German counterattack overpowered the Americans , smashing the formations and scattering men in all directions .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was going on ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I could only groan at the gesture , because even the gentlest of kisses was painful .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As she reached her car something caught her eye at the corner of the building .
tr	NP_PP_.	Both of them disappearing into the dark of the night out the open car door .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she couldn 't silence the little voice in the back of her mind that whispered this might be the last morning they ever spent together .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I was young when he died .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if he laid claim to her , without a word or a touch .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a lot of ways she 'd been the impetus for him to walk away from Titan .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know the man ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As long as she needs to .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would I even bother to say those words ?
tr	S_VP_.	Going any farther was out of the question .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The wolf shoved and clawed his way to freedom as he pushed to get to the one thing he needed so desperately .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" The vision in the living room ."
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that 's good .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They never got anything on him .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	""" Just - "" A slight shadow fell over our table ."
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not a good way to avoid the murder charge he had no intention of inviting .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	We weren 't , technically , since Zeus had taken different forms to father us and we had different mothers .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That he had won .
tr	NP_VP_.	Kimberly was hot on my heels .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many thoughts and emotions were running through him .
tr	NP_VP_.	Alec couldn 't ignore him or forgive him .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Once Noll got started he was an unstoppable force and she would rather see that energy directed somewhere that it would do some good .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it seems that Sali told Marco about an incident on the beach yesterday .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Instantly he was on his feet beside her , his hand on her arm .
tr	VP_.	Take the truck and haul ass , or shoot and add to my already inflated murder count .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I was confused .
tr	VP_.	said a thin man with an incredibly full mustache .
tr	VP_.	Onward to the mountains .
tr	NP_PP_.	Hands behind your back .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	"A female friend once described him as "" disarming , not classically handsome , but very good-looking ."
tr	S_CC_S_.	The four of us drove to the restaurant in the same car and the silence was enough to make me want to pull my hair out .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though I think she 's gone off in her own direction .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Through the crush I spot something weird rising from the depths .
tr	VP_.	was propped up next to the mouse .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"When they lit their pipes Dillon said "" Buster I 've been thinking about writing up certificates of freedom for all of the blacks on the island ."
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The last time I fell apart .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The kind of sex he 'd always had with Avery .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I slammed down that wall , that shield in my mind , in a desperate attempt to nip the affection in the bud .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What are you doing ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would they cast Arun the boy across when he could re-grow feet ?
tr	OTHER	Were they not seeing what I was seeing ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Doors slammed shut and someone fired up an engine .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But even through the fog of sleep and discomfort I was unnerved .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had she been thinking ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The yearning in her voice nearly undid him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Even Garen eventually revealed his power to the townsfolk , when he saw how well they 'd reacted to Amira .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On the way back a corrections officer stopped him and asked him to come to his office .
tr	S_VP_.	Blinding rage wrenched through him .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time his voice was a demand .
tr	S_VP_.	Leading her to imagine what it might be like to explore every inch of that muscled strength that had saved her today .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But a werewolf bite ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She could have asked any of the friends she 'd made through the years .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly Remington was there with pistol in hand , thrusting them out of the way .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why pick this city ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I gave the bouquet one last smile before walking out the door .
tr	NP_PP_.	Three days and nights without him .
tr	NP_VP_.	Simon was spared answering by Raphael 's reappearance .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she picked him up and carried him in , hoping there would be no objection .
tr	VP_.	To escape the dictator who ruled them .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Yet here they were .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The day he realized he was falling in love , a love he could never have .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I didn 't say so to myself .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Anything I could do to encourage him to give up information .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What has been perpetrated against our people is unforgivable .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As if on cue the coach stopped .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How many died outside the gates , waiting to be let in ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He half waved before walking off .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last time we fought I didn 't have a sword did I ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Above me spread a wooden structure , supported by a central wooden beam -- the underside of a table .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	He actual y laughed louder then .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The lights on the ground and the half-moon up on the eastern sky provided enough light for us to see each other .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I 'm not worth it .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Why hadn 't he made it out ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it dawned on me .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Sam smiled and looked at Liz and she smiled back .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his voice dipped , taking on a low , gravelly tone .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Now he didn 't know what was happening and he dreaded the thought of more running .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I hopped in my car , went home , and did exactly that .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"If I 'm this big thing -- this ... "" There was so much for her to realize and analyze in her way ."
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How much evidence do you need that this man has super powers .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because she wouldn 't have any answers unless she asked the right questions .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What control do you have now , eh darling ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Jade really think he was going to believe a word she said ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For several minutes it refused to do more than smoke heavily .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Upstairs the pasta sauce was boiling over on the stove , vital and red and smelling of beef .
tr	OTHER	Then of course there is that very weird sensation that I constantly get whenever I see , or get close to Sarah .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What do they want ?
tr	NP_PP_.	A month of wondering if my vampires still lived .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What am I going to do ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time her pitch was gentler than before .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why worry when it 's meant , right ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Where one began and another ended was nearly impossible to tell .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Doing everything he could to scout the area ahead .
tr	NP_VP_.	I turned and walked closer to the front bars , giving them a shake to test their strength .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you 're not alone anymore .
tr	NP_VP_.	The questions are raging in my mind .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What in the world was going on ?
tr	VP_.	Disciplined them without mercy .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Saturday they had breezed through their first round match and won a close match to reach the semis .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did you betray us ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I relaxed , kissing him back .
tr	OTHER	Especially if they go down in shallow water like this one .
tr	NP_VP_.	Andrew shook his head .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least you 're a fast learner .
tr	S_VP_.	Mentioning the legendary fat ass is motivation enough .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I got ta admit I deserved it .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What could I leave him ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I almost think she 's sadder than I am that Six is leaving in a few days .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he threw it to her right where she lay , and it struck her in the face .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At once need slammed into him , hard and imperative .
tr	NP_PP_.	Two of the best friends I ever had .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least a third of the town has been razed to the ground .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I always saw her as some sort of strong tower , a refuge of calm .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's going on ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Nobody at The New York Times 36 .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She looked up at the sky outside of the deep doorway and thought for a moment she saw the moon through a break in the clouds .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he saw a nurse standing beside the officer , a bloody big needle in her hand .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Timmy Hudson did remember his name .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he 'd first arrived at the store he 'd spotted , from his Dodge Ram 's high driving position , a burgundy Lotus .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Eleanor now had all twenty photographs .
tr	OTHER	The houses empty and dark .
tr	NP_PP_.	Any point of dominance .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Below No more gas shortages I wrote in rapid order : No more cold war .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I couldn 't think that my mother would tell me to turn my back on someone I loved .
tr	S_VP_.	Slept a sleep bordering on the comatose -- for the pain had chased him down steeper and deeper chasms into deeper and darker regions .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I usually don 't make jokes about sex and toilet paper on a second date .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he tried so hard to make people like him .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" All because of that human bitch ."
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 7 It was another early start to the day .
tr	S_VP_.	Hearing everyone harp on about Linda anyone would have thought she 'd be joining them on stage .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The air was freezing cold up here but I found it exhilarating , like plunging into ice water .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Except I was wearing jeans and a ratty Star Wars t-shirt and my hair was a stringy , unkempt mop of dark brown waves .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know that I searched out your father ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are you asking a question that you already know the answer to ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Marlborough College 's most famous graduate these days was the former Kate Middleton , Duchess of Cambridge , who would mostly likely be queen one day .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And Quinn himself was too weak to save her .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What Nicholas and Sara had was beautiful .
tr	S_VP_.	Remembering when he 'd last anticipated seeing a woman again was beyond him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Other than the housekeeper and cook , Neil had no one on site he needed to watch over during the night .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he turns to Andrew .
tr	VP_.	Loans enough money to buy a house .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	To fill in the empty spaces between jobs Collin had a deal with a large P.I. firm in Rockville .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As it turned out the reception was thoroughly enjoyable .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Gregori put her from him and simply disappeared .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Worse still is the way Mom doesn 't seem to mind .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he met with his lieutenants and messengers , giving their daily reports regarding the status of each company .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why won 't he and the Institute accept each other ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He had a smooth voice like one you might hear on the radio late at night doing commercials .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	I myself experienced such an event .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He turned and them one last hug .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I held back and allowed her to set the pace .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Buddy silently opened the door and tiptoed over to the bed .
tr	OTHER	Were there scalpels in here ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I noticed his other features and once again noted how familiar he seemed .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That second month was harder .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today she passed it off to hunger and fatigue .
tr	NP_VP_.	He flashed an encouraging smile and accepted a big hug from Molly .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he felt bad and was trying to make conversation .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was her brain toying with her now ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now they hurried over to join him .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And now , because of this , I 'm been struck down , caused to feel what I was so curious to know .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That he knew , but to hear his youngest sister 's tearful report made him restless to be on his way .
tr	S_VP_.	Staring at him were diagrams of the exact symbols that were on the Talisman .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he think that some of his other wolf friends was his mate ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her hair is pulled back in a short ponytail and she doesn 't have any makeup on .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How they were managing to work together through this was a mystery to Sage .
tr	S_VP_.	Being so aggressive in negotiations had actually gotten him out of more fights than in , which the smuggler turned commander had bet on this time around .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It 's an ugly sight and I prefer him not being so engrossed with it .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did farm workers get on their hands and knees these days ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the complete seriousness of this hits us .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it became her turn to apply the pressure as she worked her inner muscles along his length .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way he smelled .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the only family they had was in Alaska , which was too far away to depend on .
tr	NP_PP_.	The fall of an empire .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her head was held back and she was laughing .
tr	S_CC_S_.	That took more energy than the other two and Dua never had enough .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A weakness he might push past to get her alone .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I also thought you 'd never fall in love .
tr	NP_VP_.	A pang went through her body .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At first she was very aloof , even aggressive towards the two men .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How does something so strange show up in her daughter 's backpack whether her daughter knew about it or not ?
tr	OTHER	A sound that slipped past the mind and spoke to the heart .
tr	VP_.	Consistent with a sunken ship or aircraft , which cut the cable .
tr	OTHER	And how are you ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She now regretted her childishness , and thought of her parents .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For he knew the same men might be back soon with no money , and that this would be when his charity would really be tested .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she opened them again she had changed .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He also believed that it may have been a side effect from the spell cast by Allora .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Until I can hire another captain .
tr	NP_PP_.	The exact opposite of the kind of girl who could understand Mitch .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe then Chad wouldn 't have so many demons to fight .
tr	OTHER	Would she be willing to give up her fancy name brands and champagne lunches for a simple man in turnouts and a work shirt ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	When the cold air hit my skin , I almost ran back inside from the shock but Dillon grabbed my hand and walked me to the car .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	- How did you know that it is one of my favourite songs ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment I thought she might be my client 's wife .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I wiped my face with my hands I was startled by how cold they were .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't it be in the boy I believed I loved ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just found out about them , though .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Tearing off a final piece of bread I sank my teeth into its warmth and sat back to watch her eat .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now you 're free .
tr	VP_.	Haunting in a way .
tr	S_VP_.	Hosting the pricey gala apparently wasn 't enough for Crowe .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Finally he pushed away and started to get in the car .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she want him to have experienced a change of heart ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The room is dark .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And strangely I find myself laughing right along with him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I got the job at Denny 's which I will continue to work at for a few more years until the seven years are up .
tr	OTHER	""" Oh wow , I 've corrupted you ."
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They all went downstairs to wait for the guys .
tr	OTHER	I remember the moment I realized your grip was gone and then I turned around and you weren 't there .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	An eerie gold radiance still flowed from his eyes and the tip of his wand .
tr	OTHER	We both joined to escape the direction our lives were going in ; mine was heading into a life of crime and his was inching towards drugs .
tr	VP_.	said Sarah , giving hand to Paul who just rolled on the stair .
tr	OTHER	Like she 'd wrapped a hand around his heart .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What were they planning ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did it mean that 's who she had to be ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way they 'd done for Lauren .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But slowly they emerged like frightened children afraid of the dark now stepping out into a world that felt warm and bright once again .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Not what I expected to hear .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he held his breath and watched Daniel saw the Snakes were each different types of Snakes .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As the door closes for her to relive her death over and over again .
tr	VP_.	Use that time to think of ways that you can demonstrate that you 're watching me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Some men even turned and ran when lightning began to fall from a cloudless sky , while others stopped to watch in horror .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How 'd he die ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they understand how much I hated myself ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he jumps in his Chevy Impala and sets sail for the testing facility halfway across the State of Michigan .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last night I 'd been all screwed up in the head .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What made her think they would be ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When the time to fly back to America arrived he could hardly stand to be in her presence .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not even the fact that I never once saw him eat anything seemed strange .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Claire found the fighting easier to deal with than the telling tales and snide remarks she remembered from her own childhood .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she debated about absolutely everything .
tr	VP_.	Tie the nails to the string and attach one matchbox to each end .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	First you don 't want to go on vacation .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	How he found boots to contain those things I would never understand .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Her scent , the way she looked , everything captivated him .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why won 't the two troubled souls just help each other be happy ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Mr. Fellows cleared his throat .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just don 't think you can go through life being worried about ever ' little thing .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did he want to find ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Immediately the two generals fell silent and sprang to their feet .
tr	VP_.	Do not engage the enemy in any way .
tr	S_VP_.	Getting engaged would 've been pretty far beyond me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That you won 't always get what you want .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Seemed he , too , was still considering Haidar and his reactions in everything he did .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It wasn 't really a request , not the way he said it .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The powerful vibration surged to life and I gripped the banister , holding on so I wouldn 't collapse to the ground .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He carried my bag to my apartment and as I opened the door I was compelled not to let him go yet .
tr	NP_VP_.	Her emotions rolled in a twisted maelstrom .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was this Ranma ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where are your pills ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The blood of a Shadowhunter .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though it was rather amazing that she was aware of his body 's reaction with her own body reacting to his touch .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were they thinking of me now ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Just a lot of tourists and such .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why hadn 't he called her ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The passage itself was silent .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if a Jew would have been mad enough to do such a thing once .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she wanted him too .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe one more nudge of inspiration will end this permanently .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then everything went black .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He contracted pneumonia a month ago and the physicians could not find a way to combat the disease since he was already so ill .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Darrin grabbed a rusty crescent wrench while Derrick grabbed a rusty hacksaw .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this had something to do with salvaging his pride ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe Jennifer had spouted off about that to her parents .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What would 've sold quickly as little as a year ago lingered on the market now .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was this supposed to be my heritage or something ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time his fingers came to rest on a relatively plain looking trinket .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who could blame him ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I wasn 't .
tr	NP_PP_.	nk of something that .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he opened the trunk lid they discovered that they could put the picnic basket on the trunk floor .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How she left him feeling dizzy with need .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How much more betrayed must that woman be feeling ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Dark green eyes on blue .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Which begged another interesting question : why weren 't the Changed lunch for run-of-the-mill scavengers ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his hands were between their bodies .
tr	OTHER	Xander and I both turn to look at her , and the other people in the room look terrified .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Green Lightning 's ears pricked and she snorted .
tr	NP_PP_.	A palace of iniquity , to be sure .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then we won 't have to have this little talk again .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where had he gone ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Especially after what had happened to Sophie on the night she 'd had a one-night stand and become pregnant despite using a condom .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What haven 't I tried ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He simply asked that they all turn them on and hold them , watching to insure no one tampered with them .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe she would wear her contacts instead of her glasses .
tr	OTHER	Had he seen me ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I didn 't get a handle on it I was going to literally throw myself onto him .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Inside he found a stack of oversized towels on a shelf .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	You still think we 're freaks .
tr	NP_PP_.	Even here in Jonesville , Lexi .
tr	NP_VP_.	Ted and I had a wonderfully unhurried dinner at the Sands , went to our room and made slow , passionate , outstanding love .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Away from the details of death and horror that were so vivid in the minds of the newcomers .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he lays me open again .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He was breathing heavily and his head was thrown back , as he groaned in pleasure from her touch .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I leave something in his car ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" A couple of vacations ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Kenny would rarely say the word , as if fearful he might catch it by talking about it .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he do that ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But destiny waits for no one .
tr	NP_PP_.	a direct challenge to the King .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now they were enjoying a glass of wine , curled up together on her couch .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you miss the last four dozen attacks on us ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she wiggles out of Logan 's arms and runs toward me full force .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Even if I didn 't believe it as I wanted to wish to be me fallen , at least for once , in good hands .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I hope this lie makes her feel better .
tr	VP_.	""" Then , what ?"
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Now Marco was telling her she had the potential for tripling her revenue in eighteen months ?
tr	S_VP_.	Knowing why I 've got issues doesn 't make 'em go away .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I tore open his throat and drank his blood ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The end of the Stuart Dynasty ?
tr	OTHER	Soon we were moving up again and then we came up at an opening .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Only when the squad car carrying Marshall had pulled away did Mike turn to look for Amber .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Dad quickly switched lanes and laid on the horn .
tr	S_VP_.	Having Dorian in me felt good and right .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she pick that bottle over Sara ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As you can tell I am not American .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But first she needed to lock herself in a closet and scream bloody murder .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the Escalade shakes and jolts as Isaac and another guard crash against the rear .
tr	S_VP_.	Lying to him would not be acceptable behavior .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't he take the traffic cone away with him ?
tr	VP_.	Don 't even say it .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I looked at my dad and he had tears in his eyes .
tr	OTHER	Seconds later , they were gone , back around the corner the way they 'd come .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the shirt fell wide open she slid her hands up and shoved it off his shoulders , leaving his body bare to her gaze .
tr	VP_.	announced the florid , vaguely gelatinous man with the broken microphone .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though her series is Paranormal Romance , that 's not all she intends to write .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I can finally see that I always was .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Daniel know that Interview with the Vampire was in the bookstores ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What have you done ?
tr	NP_VP_.	This is the game .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As she walked along the wall she knocked first on one door , then the one beside it .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As I approached the house I had my first coherent thought that would stick in my mind .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he did not in fact know all that had been taking place here for the past seven weeks .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	For me to be rested .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	To make sure her daughter didn 't feel self-conscious .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would Ms. Carol send him back to this mess ?
tr	OTHER	( as self ) No , no it 's not !
tr	NP_PP_.	Her excitement over the stuffed swan , eating cotton candy as if for the first time .
tr	OTHER	Do you know the meaning of your name ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Much like Sawyer , as I 'd fully realized today .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or at least I should have had a plan .
tr	NP_PP_.	Two kids from down the road , big in vehicle crime and owing us several large favours .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By the time Ben arrived home it had become common knowledge that he 'd fathered a child during the relationship with the officer 's wife .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We all worked twice as hard as he did that session , because he and Edwards were the only ones to have freshly sharpened blades .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps it was the manner in which he spoke to everyone , as if he were better than they .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That I would die before I would let anything happen to them .
tr	VP_.	Thank you for calling .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I lie , telling them he is with Matt .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Ada and I nearly jumped out of our skin .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Eventually I would 've had my foot in the door in Syracuse .
tr	NP_PP_.	At least in Leslie 's opinion .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But his heart swelled inescapably .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Despite the warmth of the evening air she felt as though ice crystals were settling on her skin .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she approached the other side of the wall , hopping up and crouching on the stone railing as she scanned the city .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now the sight of her strolling slowly down the bridal path toward him turned his insides into jelly .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why willingly take on more crap ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Taking her breath away as she gasped .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I didn 't want to be rude to Alec , or make Grayson think I wasn 't following instructions .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His lips were moving but he wasn 't saying anything , at least nothing intelligible .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he began struggling against his bonds again .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I 'm a diet junkie with a ballooning weight problem .
tr	VP_.	Wanting to touch him again .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I spit out the question and held a short breath .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	WHO EVER HEARD OF THE DEATH OF RATS RIDING A CAT ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Someone she 'd trusted , who knew her .
tr	NP_PP_.	Her concern for him .
tr	VP_.	got the lease and started its renovations .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course he has a driver .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	To Eris it seemed like it had been carefully measured and precisely drawn .
tr	S_VP_.	Getting pregnant required a man .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I know Dad trusted you .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Giving the males vasectomies seemed a bit extreme .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	the corporal desperately fought to keep his voice from cracking .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she forget that Nick had seen it before ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The same words he heard most days , though this time there was steel in the tone , menace that could not be overlooked .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we need to find the traps .
tr	S_VP_.	Hoping he would come to her to tell her of her grandfather 's condition .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I asked she might feel like she has to ... follow through , even if she changes her mind and doesn 't want to .
tr	OTHER	The minute he 'd looked at the rack , this suit had caught his eye .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time she pulled them down determinedly and gasped when he sprang forth .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment she imagined all her darkest fears coming true .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every time she used her credit card she waited with in held breath for it to be rejected .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I got back to my towel an older woman was sitting up looking at the water a few yards behind from me .
tr	OTHER	They both came to me early .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the answer to that -- he realized -- was to do the unthinkable .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because it wasn 't just the ring .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The question reminded me of the last time he offered it up and I knew there was at least the hint of an innuendo there .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although Dylan didn 't seem to have noticed .
tr	S_VP_.	Making a decision like that didn 't send me into a cold sweat .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it did make it bearable .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was the point of dumping Geoffrey when she couldn 't have Nicolas ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Nothing mattered to her but to save Byron .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I not believe the man ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	while simultaneously leaping atop the boy and drawing the heavy cloak about him as that awful light threatened to break forth anew .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She 'd pretty much promised him sex tonight , which raised the stakes for her and might be simply a fun romp for him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we headed for Jeff 's house and each took a long bath .
tr	NP_PP_.	Clothes in the closet .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Stroking his hair she realised her feelings for Johnny ran counter to her learned understanding of Earl and other men she 'd known .
tr	S_VP_.	Remembering the couples in school wearing all matchy-matchy makes me vomit with their PDA .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Right in front of the entrance , so I can see you .
tr	NP_VP_.	I squeeze my eyes closed more tightly .
tr	OTHER	Or if she had , about her own experiences .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so I turned to Saint Mer .
tr	VP_.	Let them take the punishment instead .
tr	NP_VP_.	It 's too dangerous .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly he thinks he 's a sex god or something .
tr	NP_PP_.	All because of my past mistakes .
tr	S_CC_S_.	This was too good and nothing could have pried me away from him in that moment .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now I 'm dying , leaving her .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because Bia doesn 't think we 'll have to flee doesn 't mean she 's not strong .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What had once appeared perfect now seemed overcooked and bland .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How we doin ' back there ?
tr	S_VP_.	Ending on a highpoint is the normal way to close a story .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Kellee still wasn 't speaking to me , which was great as far as I was concerned .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there was Lia .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Not if there were vampires there to run you down .
tr	NP_VP_.	I fed it into a trash can .
tr	OTHER	Though he had been a great dancer the few times it actually suited him to partner her at parties .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He much preferred that view .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could seven people generate so much work ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much had happened since , I 'd forgotten to even attempt to find out more about the ship .
tr	VP_.	Beat him to death in the most painful ways .
tr	S_VP_.	Picking the lock wasn 't as easy as he 'd thought .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she have made the highly abandoned response she had made ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What could he do ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I have good news .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Navigation systems still functional .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before she got the chance her instincts screamed at her again .
tr	VP_.	Detailed toy soldiers from the World Before .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She 'd told herself they were too young to understand their own lives .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He looked puzzled for a moment , like she should have understood what he was talking about , then looking directly into her eyes he asked .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I jog to the side of the runner 's path , pretending that I need to work out a cramp .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it doesn 't .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	"But hot blondes she 'd "" fought "" before were rare ."
tr	NP_PP_.	Even more about pushing it away .
tr	NP_VP_.	The guy inside the tank began to wake at the movement and struggled .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his mouth sealed over hers with a fierceness that touched her heart and rekindled her banked yearning from earlier .
tr	NP_PP_.	Her chest pumps with a laugh .
tr	NP_VP_.	The sense of walking a tightrope to get to the end he wanted was very strong .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She put her dress around her feet in case the rat came back .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	"Maybe it couldn "" t find it ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The adept readied himself in case the boy passed out .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that girl wouldn 't challenge her dad .
tr	VP_.	sneered the dark voice .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she dare risk it ?
tr	VP_.	Married to a vampire .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The White House is her marker and I 'm merely the carrier pigeon .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	After Ryder finishes his bottle I carry him back into his room and try to catch a few hours of sleep .
tr	VP_.	Demanding that he finish what they 'd started in the mine .
tr	OTHER	Though my heart raced in my ears I suddenly felt very tired , like I could slip away and bring this nightmare to a close .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she talking about ?
tr	OTHER	Please hurry and get rid of him .
tr	NP_PP_.	You with your long red hair and piercing green eyes .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they both winked out like a switch .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Never again would she have to set foot in Rubicon Ranch .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that 's exactly how I want it .
tr	NP_VP_.	This was the cue he was waiting for .
tr	OTHER	Runs a profitable business near the outskirts of the city .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Until one day I read a book about intuitive eating .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his two earlier acquaintances left him with the three men .
tr	VP_.	Tell him he needs to assemble , in secret , as many trusted men and women as possible and await my orders .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did it mean to their relationship ?
tr	S_VP_.	Accidentally incinerating her papers would be disastrous and for her , an event not without precedence .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why shouldn 't I warn her ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have it wrong , or did I ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now it was time to clear everything up , straighten out the world and hope that everything landed the way he wanted .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I wanted to do was lean out the window and see if I could crawl up the wall to the roof .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	"Which I know sounds silly , because you 're this big , strong man , "" she said , reaching out to touch his arm lightly ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many people come to visit .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she wooed him right back , rubbing against his powerful calves with soft , tantalizing purrs .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she have been so stupid to come out her alone ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he hurting for the woman , too ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not even several hours of rough sex followed by a deep feeding had eased the sense of foreboding that had haunted him for the past two weeks .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was this man ?
tr	S_VP_.	To have Death Drive say the exact same line despite all that change made this whole thing entirely unbelievable .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever magic Teel had left behind knew that I 'd given up .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it was quiet .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Not wanting my scalp to be wrenched from my head I listened and started walking to wherever he was directing me .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Clearly he wanted to record the band and from what Stu had heard of the records Grace had given him that had to be a good thing .
tr	S_VP_.	Just feeling him touch me was now making my heart do crazy things .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she can know that he has an inkling of who she is .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In any case , what we find there may be invaluable .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the Captain know where he spent most of his time , where his secret corner was ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The night I 'd met Logan .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What was left of the facility lay in scraps and shambles .
tr	NP_VP_.	She could not believe her eyes .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	My heart was beating as fast as the one I heard on the screen .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They then heated the fat up to such a point that the fat itself began to bubble and burn .
tr	OTHER	Then the plane pulled up farther and we were out of the clouds .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On her heels was a lovely brunette who flashed him a smile so warm and genuine he could see why she was in such demand .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Taro carefully aimed his pistol at it and fired .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she knew it wasn 't because he was furious .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment his mind was in chaos , a wild mix of jealousy , rage and fear , things he had never experienced .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Amanda had done the impossible .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As she reaches the end of the hallway she is met with a bricked off wall .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	If you want her you 'll have to work to woo her , and I won 't lie and tell you it 'll be easy .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Asking her this wouldn 't change that .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was he letting her go ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I put it out of my head .
tr	OTHER	Maybe after a short nap .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I was held prisoner I learned a few things about him .
tr	S_CC_S_.	There was longing in his words and I searched his face , not believing that I had that effect .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Which would show the first weakness ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Demons from the evil that spawned them .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Shaking with emotion I moved away , knowing full well I spoke merely out of enraged stupidity and hopelessness .
tr	NP_PP_.	Three days of pure hell .
tr	NP_PP_.	Explorer of some renown .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like he didn 't really know what he should be saying .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She merely glanced at it and saw the perfect move in her head .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the beast stopped .
tr	NP_VP_.	I stood to move her plate and my own back to the tray before turning to her .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The quiet embrace in the back of his limo where we held each other so tightly there wasn 't room for anyone or anything else but us .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only then was I satisfied .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He cut open a gash in my arm and I cried out in agony .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I pushed myself through those early weeks , telling myself Tim wouldn 't have been any help anyway .
tr	VP_.	Ain 't Gone ' N ' Give Up On Love -- Stevie Ray Vaughn & Double Trouble 16 .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he 's gone .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did I believe ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was the man whom he had led to a hot stream and tucked up in bed , telling him not to drink the strange water ?
tr	S_VP_.	Picking a Blue would have been too divisive for the current state of the Tower .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course they have to marry each other , Antonio .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After several attempts I read the thing .
tr	NP_VP_.	I wasn 't feeling very affectionate at the moment .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Down corridors MacMillan heavy-duty weapons rolled , guns bristling like quills .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Spike stooped to pick it up and Ed shoved him again .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What kind of man was he to run a colony ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time the sound was wary .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We arrived at my street and I took her to my house so she could see Sadie and the puppies .
tr	NP_PP_.	A pair of young men .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I enjoy it ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because I 'm in love with her .
tr	S_VP_.	To roll himself all over her until she coated every part of him .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I tell you the cops think it was some drug dealer wandering in off the streets ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last year I called Walter a couple of days before Christmas .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he crossing on another floor , caught in the elevator , or slower than Goon 1 ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The students reluctantly did as they were bidden , wishing rather to gossip and theorize about the events rather than deal with them in a reasonable fashion .
tr	NP_VP_.	I planted my hands on his stomach , my eyes meeting his , silently asking him to lead me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Others it was a curse .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That you 're not even supposed to be in the EOD .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Besides Warren probably expected him to be there along with the rest of the family .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The sound rattles around the cavernous and dark space but we feel no fear .
tr	S_VP_.	Replacing it was a burning under his skin that seemed to reach into the muscle beneath it .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	All of a sudden she stood outside the car .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course the flood and landslide could have had something to do with it as well .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had I just done ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she say Bland ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He thought that no one could count on them to do war and play war like men .
tr	NP_VP_.	He rolled his eyes and walked past her to the Christmas tree farm behind their house .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It was opened with extreme care and the contents emotionally flattened everyone .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that might not be enough once Quentin Hale realized what the others had done .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The first time you slept I could put it down to the sake .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How dare he say the things he did ?
tr	NP_PP_.	One conversation after another .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How much oil did it take that day ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Talk to the others , Norman .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She wished she could find something about him she didn 't like .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he had no reason to keep her .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just don 't share it .
tr	VP_.	Judging by her present location , not too much longer .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then my canopy flew me out of range .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If he 'd have just kept his big mouth shut I might have snuck in without Mrs. Pearson seein ' me .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As Max thought of all the things he would do to her , magic coursed through his blood in a heated wave .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	CHAPTER NINE In the past day have you felt lonely or overwhelmed ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she was standing by herself .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I let the werewolf have you , for a time .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I can 't say that .
tr	NP_VP_.	Chloe couldn 't believe he 'd signed his note with the nickname she 'd given him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I felt that I had gone crazy yet I wished that craziness was not enough for me to love her .
tr	S_VP_.	Washing away the worries made her feel a million times better .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the two left .
tr	NP_VP_.	I knew she didn 't want to draw more attention to me .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And frankly I needed to see Amelia off before I could really focus on the mission at hand .
tr	OTHER	Not when she could so wholly redeem me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every few seconds she would stop and drag him down , before hastening forwards again .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her knees weakened and her heart beat wildly .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he want her to speak ?
tr	OTHER	"Why couldn "" t he make her understand ?"
tr	NP_VP_.	She wanted him to make love with her because he desired her .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I wonder if he repelled her toward the bed with the spell they learned in England , but how ?
tr	VP_.	""" So what about you ?"
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are you not happy having three items from your list of forty-four ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he was powerless to resist .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like in a cabinet if there 's one you can fit into .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Victoria just ignored them and continued to walk straight to the nearby forest .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The wagons they used for traveling and dozens of other items that the Nomads treasured .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he was already using powerful strokes to propel the chair down the hall to the small cage .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And there he was again .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His cast became dislodged and his arm fell .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	A whore , like everyone always tells me .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before I reached class I passed a few of the other football players , who were busily dissecting Friday night 's game .
tr	OTHER	Not happy about this .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because you have had your food taken away in the past .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he surprised me .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps they were smarter than they looked .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Beside it was a U-shaped sofa with a table in the middle .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What kind of person would chase after her in the middle of the woods ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When she let go she was smiling .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They all had him on retainer .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	John just winked at me .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once everyone was ready we took off .
tr	OTHER	For so long I had just wanted to make her smile .
tr	S_VP_.	Waiting for Mrs. Z to tell me the work I 've turned in isn 't good enough .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the stables he dismounted , waited for her to do the same .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she 'd thought was a window was a square of thick , solid blocks of glass .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it wasn 't air conditioning because there was none .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last year it handled twenty-six million passengers .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After two text messages and an email his back was against the wall .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	We were both too engrossed on the code she was entering to notice anything but the keypad .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He and Lori had always had a special relationship and he was glad she 'd asked him to come watch her work .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Cale keep anything special there ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Cale reluctantly forced himself to relax and waited .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he bother to find out why she 'd missed school ?
tr	S_VP_.	Picking the yogurt shop for tonight 's piece isn 't just for artistic reasons .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	People who died here constantly relived that death in the life beyond it .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He slowly led her away from the horse , and stood with the magnificent view behind him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For Alexander the Third to become Alexander the ... Great .
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting on Temp 's back as he paddled around in a circle , unable to climb up the steep rocks that surrounded them .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really believe I would wait for him in a room all day while he enjoyed himself with someone else ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a single moment he 's the only thing holding us together .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only she wasn 't sure if the mistake was sleeping with someone she didn 't know or letting him leave her .
tr	VP_.	Forget him and move on .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many questions swam in her head .
tr	VP_.	Take them to safety .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	To get inside my factory you must be willing to play .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes a whisper , little sobs , babyish laughter and a voice that becomes confused with Helena 's so that often these two ghosts merge into one .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was this trip really a good idea ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The fools really had no idea what they were getting themselves into .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they talk about their nests .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That she would help him in battle .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By the time Fiona arrived Linda realised Trudie might have a good point .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The witch thought she had done away with her but Lucian tricked her .
tr	VP_.	To soar while they all fell further behind ?
tr	S_VP_.	Just seeing her was enough to ease the aching inside him .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I really think I could keep her close by avoiding my morning routine ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Both of them simply nodded .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if she 'd had a little kitchen accident .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe Sadie 's Garden .
tr	VP_.	Outcasts because of what they were - considered evil .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And perhaps Jesse deserved the reprimand .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this must be the Battalion .
tr	VP_.	To be your First Escort .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could you do that to me ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then he 'd unexpectedly come into contact with Belinda in Las Vegas .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he despise her for being more clever than him ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He stopped and asked the nearest black what time they stopped work .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he grabbed his coat and headed back to his Gran 's house across the recreation ground .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Unless , somehow , she hadn 't read into the comment the way I had ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Why she 'd only begrudgingly acknowledged Mateo 's existence once a year for his whole life .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After that I 'll go to the bakery to find out if I can learn anything from Elizabeth .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Outside there were the milling crowd discussing the answer to Alamogordo that they had just witnessed .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All day his body had reminded him of his own unfulfilled need to be buried inside Leah 's silken , wet , warmth .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps she could unravel what 's happening between me and Elliott , how our fake romance seems to be turning into something very real .
tr	OTHER	Isn 't it Coach 's job to make sure everyone 's on the same page ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Quickly rolling down the window he stared at Devon through bloodshot , slightly swollen eyes .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At 18 he fell through a dimensional rip and ended up studying under a guild of brain hackers called The Pee .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did he mean by that ?
tr	OTHER	I waited silently , now and then staring out the small window to make sure no one was coming .
tr	NP_VP_.	I blinked at him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She still likes Baldwin better .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just as I reach the door I stop .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now I will heed her advice and learn to walk in these ridiculous shoes so that tonight I might be a gazelle on Quinn 's arm .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He just wasn 't willing to part with it .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Within a week Tom had the routine down and no longer needed help from Cody to get up and find his way around the compound .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes strong emotions draw them toward you .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then her eyes widened when she saw all the words after the date had become misty and unreadable .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there would have been three Jacksons on the airplane manifest , not two Jacksons and a Taylor .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I started trying researching him .
tr	OTHER	So why would he be okay with her kissing one of his best friends ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Answered Lea in surprise .
tr	VP_.	questioned Napoleon about his surroundings .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	How I wish I could still sail .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there was the small box she 'd found in her desk drawer .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know that ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he mad I 'd spoken to him when he 'd told me not to ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because I was sick didn 't mean the horses had to starve .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The voices were getting fainter and Collin and Charlie opened the door wider so they could hear better .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though Colin didn 't know that and wouldn 't believe it if someone told him .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His hands moved lower down the sides of his h * ps and he pulled more ties so his hides loosened at his waist .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" The insufferable arrogance of the prototypes ."
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he took it off the stove .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At seven she headed down again but with little hope of him being there .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he glanced back at me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	His expression slightly hardens .
tr	S_VP_.	Getting into a new position was more important than investigating Dusky 's unease .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Unless he asked the right question they gave him no information .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	My only concern was to get to Kennan , to tell him I loved him before he left .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If they have a spark of aptitude then they are embraced and relieved of more gold .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Not until he got Amber away from that psychopath .
tr	S_VP_.	Pleasing his mate was a compulsion .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It was plausible but he gave me the information a little too freely for my taste .
tr	S_VP_.	Bringing the qualities of this room into focus and silently expressing my wish might or might not have changed anything .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I woke she was already on the phone .
tr	NP_VP_.	He got up to leave .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why else wouldn 't she have confided in him ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before he could open his mouth Jorge 's footsteps clattered down the stairs .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would we need some person to take away our sins ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I remembered .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can we possibly move forward into this bouquet of blinking lights without detection ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he was there , towering over the girls .
tr	S_VP_.	Trading them isn 't her first priority .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had she said it ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she sound like a little girl in that moment ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I was little she was a great mom , the sort of person that happy kids remember when they grow up .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did he come to that conclusion ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he slammed down the phone .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he dove beneath the water 's surface .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But perhaps she wore her sweetness and naivety as a shield .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I have had something of the same sort in my own life .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it hit me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Mr. Clancy dutifully hoisted his pack and started off , the others quickly following .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like there was any true privacy in this school , or this town for that matter .
tr	OTHER	But we both knew it was .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As though he had seen battles and worn them out .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she just say that I 'm fat ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Hopefully she wouldn 't have to use it because if she did , she wasn 't sure how she would .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What else could I say ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you get the arrow ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then a scrambling followed .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Half an hour later Raven glanced anxiously up at the sky .
tr	NP_VP_.	I didn 't much like him for that .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If the charm Alicia had worn was like this one , then it meant she too was a strong magic user trying to mask her abilities .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	CHAPTER 6 Apocalypse Link didn 't stop running until he made it al the way through the pitch-black Tunnel .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could someone as capable as him have let this happen ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or at least she tried to .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Glancing around the room I searched for Gee .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The house was dark but a chunky spotted horse fidgeted at the fence , tossing his head and stomping his feet .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though I 'm glad I fall in your favorable category .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It seemed to happen in slow motion but in reality it all happened so incredibly fast .
tr	VP_.	Not going to happen .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are new people here ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Grey stooped down at the edge of the lake under the same tree the queen had stopped to rest under .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had she become such a freaking idiot ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I get up and pace , back and forth from the door all the way to the bathroom and back again .
tr	OTHER	As recommended by the nut in the new shop .
tr	OTHER	Would my mother be there waiting for me already ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he have turned into this cruel hearted man ?
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing the blindfold eased any anxiety she had left .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When I ask her where she 'd been she says she had been with a girlfriend having a few drinks .
tr	NP_PP_.	The City of Angels .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	This thing just wouldn 't die .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he hung up .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she returned she had a small boy with her .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was he swimming professionally when he had no passion for it ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He had smelled like piss and cherry wine when he brought the screaming dog in .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Which memories rule you right now ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely he 'd been more than happy to carry out Josh 's orders and spike my water .
tr	S_CC_S_.	What happened to her was so tragic and I hoped that she didn 't suffer .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just knew men always hurt .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because he didn 't want her in the line of fire .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she got the hang of it and started to hit the target .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Later that day Connie was telling Keith what had happened .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he released her hand she turned to look at her sister .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	"Who is "" they "" ?"
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What have I done to deserve this ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she couldn 't stop crying .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this is it ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would people call me ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The Mackenzie dogs that had followed Ainsley and Daniel started barking , wanting to play too .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	His hand gently cupped my cheek and his long fingers wrapped around my neck and pulled me forward .
tr	NP_PP_.	Eating lunch with Jack and Jules .
tr	VP_.	Can 't imagine it , now .
tr	NP_PP_.	No history of ever having been here before .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What was interesting was they didn 't charge you anything if they couldn 't find the person that you were looking for .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I won ´ t think like that ... anymore .
tr	VP_.	Saw the flat , nondescript features , beady gray eyes , and harsh , uncompromising mouth .
tr	NP_VP_.	Forte said to keep the chat moving .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He didn 't know exactly where the hit-and-run was going to take place and there was no information available to him to reduce his search area .
tr	NP_VP_.	Her hand 's on the doorknob .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there was a low , rumbling thunder .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way her eyes bug out ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Yet here we were , stranded , with no way to get him the help he needed .
tr	S_VP_.	Running always helped me gather my thoughts .
tr	S_VP_.	Realizing how screwed up he was .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	twelve I drove back to the motel very slowly and carefully .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It was almost like a mouse click , although I had to wonder what happened if you were trying to select and dust blew into your face .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The first signs of morning began to show at the sky lightened and the street lights turned off .
tr	VP_.	Come by in about an hour .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	"Did King think he could do this to me because he "" owned "" me like some pet ?"
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That her parents , particularly her mother , had chosen to lie to her was incomprehensible .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In another I didn 't .
tr	NP_PP_.	A sixth sense for matching people .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe there was no mental aspect needed .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I had gotten so used to weekdays being the quiet , restful days in the parks that it hadn 't occurred to me it could be otherwise .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 'd I do , knock you out of first place somewhere ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many of the kids chimed beside him had grown to accept this .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She looked at me steadily for a moment and I met her steely gaze .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the kids that attended this years in the summer of 1960 would undoubtedly say this one was the best as of present .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What must it be like to know that the parent you once loved was responsible for such evil acts ?
tr	S_VP_.	Grabbing onto her wheels didn 't seem to do much more than burn her hands .
tr	NP_VP_.	The guards led her back through a series of hallways .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he secured it with a D-ring to VIN 's suit connector .
tr	VP_.	Especially in his profession .
tr	NP_VP_.	He put the top down , giving her a clear view of the sky .
tr	S_VP_.	Moving back to her desk Callie refused to look at her friend .
tr	VP_.	Resting for the busy day ahead .
tr	NP_PP_.	Everything except the journal , which she 'd never found .
tr	S_VP_.	Getting away was supposed to be the easy part !
tr	OTHER	Just know that I won 't be going with you .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course it was a five-star place .
tr	NP_VP_.	She melted into his arms , opening her mouth as he deepened the kiss .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Missy know about it ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I was wrong when I pictured him on a Lame Deer mountainside , swearing and lashing out at whatever his broken heart felt like destroying .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When that happens those marks -- the tattoos -- look like black rivers flowing on his skin .
tr	NP_PP_.	The Land of beauty and purity , Rosetta !
tr	NP_VP_.	The uncomfortable look on his face made her stomach sink .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For maybe then you will know , without a shadow of a doubt , which is which .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Tess being here was different .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then all goes dark .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If he got any closer there was a good chance he would reach out and touch her .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Obviously it was a place where speeches were made .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	"Henry shook his head , "" Last time she caught me with pudding I was on bathroom duty !"
tr	S_VP_.	Playing football keeps Logan in great shape .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much for hoping he 'd be optimistic .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you see it ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Hopefully he speaks Spanish too .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Once more Maverick smoothly ended the conflict by promising to sit between them .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then all hell broke loose .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But maybe Madeleine had put that inspiration in her mind , just like she 'd shown Jonathan the route to Constanza 's .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What they left behind were narrow lines of perfect blackness .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did you do it ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like I 'm really going to leave the man who gives me the most incredible orgasms I 've ever experienced .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That she would invite them inside so they could destroy him ?
tr	VP_.	cried Simon , as he backed away slowly from the giant beast .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did I get in here ?
tr	S_VP_.	Waking up in the middle of the day was hard enough .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she has never loved back .
tr	S_VP_.	Nodding in assent Pierce fell into step with the Doctor as they leisurely followed the road to Rooks Bay .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then we both grew serious and he said , "" Wow Erin , that 's better than what you 've been hoping for ."
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did she break ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When was this guy just going to go away ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have the right one ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Apparently Smoke was accustomed to sliding through the mental hedge .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely there were ways of locating someone inside a foreign country .
tr	OTHER	But was there a bullet locked inside him , a bullet that could infect him and kill him ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They all headed towards Alyosha 's room .
tr	NP_VP_.	She closed the door behind her , smiling her thanks to the man who had shown her in .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What concerned him was the amount of drugs in her system .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But strange was good .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she dreaming the whole thing ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I needed him in my life like I needed the sun .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" No one besides her physician ."
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once the song ended he didn 't let her go .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Perhaps there is someone out there who knows where she is or what happened to her the night she disappeared .
tr	S_VP_.	asked Raja , sleepily , after he stumbled down the staircase .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For that is who that section of the Bible is written for .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Or she 'd gone back to her mother 's studio ... ? .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the place was mine .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When had she become so at ease with her murderous secondary life ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If the music hadn 't stopped .
tr	S_CC_S_.	When Ron returned after the paramedics took Rich 's body away , his room was a shambles and the bear was gone .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But right now I need rest .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	In situations such as our current lot it was becoming clear the reasoning behind such activities as our family found ourselves in the predicament we were in .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The effort alone seemed to make me less than I 'd been before - as though I had screamed out part of myself .
tr	S_VP_.	Just having powers is a bit much for me to handle .
tr	NP_VP_.	He said he didn 't want me leaving the country until everything checked out .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I didn 't believe that .
tr	NP_VP_.	I started to turn away and then paused .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After high school I worked at a department store for three years .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now she was talking to him during that week , that lost week ... .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time she did a pretty good job of sounding tough .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Although , I agreed to it only because he seemed so eager to make it clear it would never happen again .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	While she sat with the ringing phone a short , balding man in a red windbreaker joined her in the room .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The pilot was the same middle-aged gentleman who flew the plane when we went to St. Thomas but this time there was also a flight attendant .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Even if it hurt like hell to hear .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" An army of dark Nephilim ?"
tr	OTHER	Never let it own you .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What in the world could I get him that would mean something ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time the man went as white as a sheet .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know she secretly didn 't want to marry ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet he didn 't .
tr	OTHER	She was as tough as any woman he 'd ever met , and yet she suddenly seemed so fragile .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had she ever imagined that she loved this man ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What will you get out of it ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why wouldn 't she be thinking about him ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he intend to kill them both with his undoubted command of the elements ?
tr	OTHER	Desperate to be filled by him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	You would want these as a backup in case the electronics failed .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know that I never make my bed ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whether he was Troy 's father or not didn 't matter to her .
tr	VP_.	said Nomi to the little turtle .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What could the doctor tell her that she didn 't already know ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a few moments he heard Soldado wading through the shallow river water towards his boat moored out in the darkness .
tr	S_VP_.	To intimate places on her body .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only she didn 't move , not an inch .
tr	VP_.	Apologize for not being more courteous when he 'd been at the Keep ?
tr	VP_.	asked Allison after a moment or two .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How dare she sit there so calmly , as if nothing were wrong , and speak to him so flippantly ?
tr	OTHER	Although he had to admit he at least was able to get some decent conversations during the day 's travel .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I jumped down and ate my breakfast because I was sure that Jack would make good on his word if I tempted him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I lie there with my face in the water , watching the man moan .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a spit second his heart lurched just a little at the thought of Lambert 's .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you looked you could see the sun fast setting over the horizon .
tr	NP_VP_.	He was relieved to see that he had left it in a tidy condition .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A demon she 'd have to kill .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I know I 'm not either .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was then I took my leave , in the Abbot 's carriage .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the heck had happened ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As I walked my mind wandered .
tr	VP_.	To fool a shrink ?
tr	OTHER	""" Tris , what 's going on ?"
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I can 't speak .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A date we would likely cancel on account of me running for my life .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once he was dressed he raced downstairs to the dining room , where his recently arrived guests had assembled .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really like her ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time she smiled .
tr	NP_PP_.	Stay on the move .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was that supposed to be a secret ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he sheathed himself within her in one smooth , seemingly endless thrust .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Each day they were apart he felt like he was dying inside .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If only she could see in to their heads like we could .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there is Sally .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One by one the brothers headed out the door .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she didn 't even see a flicker of recognition cross his face .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Andrew get off early ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Finally she stopped outside a wide entrance that split in the center of the doorway .
tr	NP_PP_.	A literal waste of space .
tr	VP_.	came the quiet voice in the stillness .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Half the time he doesn 't get home until almost eight .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The first week I floated in a strange trance spending lots of money and never counting how much I actually had .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As she was dying she begged me to stop .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I meant to ask was if you 're all right .
tr	S_VP_.	Watching the others lean on my brother for support made me wonder .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What were the terms ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Talking politics was a relief to him , when he was desperate to escape from a situation he could not escape .
tr	S_VP_.	Playing off how pissed I am because of my temper ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I was just turning my attention back to the mouse when the racket started up behind me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I suddenly knew what the boy had meant by his questions .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If they had more energy they might have run towards it .
tr	NP_PP_.	The playground near our old apartment .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I carried on .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How does that fit with the Post-War Dream , eh Grey ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she had done so many times in the years she raised them .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he could tell that any form of affection might break down what little control she had left .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it was definitely Paul the whole time .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But nothing she 'd experienced before had prepared her for this aching , needy hunger and that was just from one kiss .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She scoots in on the bed next to me and I put the book down on my nightstand .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Not while he and Oliver were fighting so many Reapers .
tr	OTHER	He kissed me and rubbed up against me and then he pulled down his zipper and asked me to kiss him down there .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The band laughed and Johnnie put his hands up .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he 'd never been one to dodge anything either .
tr	OTHER	For once I didn 't have anything to say .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps it was just a natural trait .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I take it with me , stuffing it into my jeans pocket .
tr	NP_PP_.	No use in lying .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I blow on the spark and soon I have a blaze .
tr	VP_.	strips from the bottom of the blanket and motioned her over .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they ever tell this story , he wondered ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	He tipped his head back and his laughter boomed , sending her heartbeats scattering all over the jet 's lush carpeting .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he has to catch me because my knees give out .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he was warning me off her .
tr	NP_PP_.	The solution to the infestation .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That he didn 't want to be found .
tr	NP_PP_.	A burst of mean , raucous laughter .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	---------- It was around noon when Alex left her Winnebago .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And there it is .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But you have a life Cage .
tr	S_CC_S_.	There was an alcove with a water fountain and he crowded her into it , pressing her into a corner and cupping her face in his hands .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way he says it sends a shiver through me , and I snake my hand through the space between us until I 'm touching his .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you set fire to my house ?
tr	VP_.	said Eddie , who seemed genuinely surprised .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All the while this happened I had a freaky feeling about the whole getting into his mind business .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he offered her a mocking salute , as though he knew she could see him , and strode calmly to the fence , which he jumped .
tr	OTHER	If it ever even made it on that list .
tr	VP_.	Ask them not to pawn the TV .
tr	NP_PP_.	Validation on a paper plate .
tr	OTHER	Seems highly unlikely we would both have such a rare ability , doesn 't it ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He quickly made his way to the side of the building and vanished without even looking back at his coat .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That she could make whatever decisions she wanted .
tr	VP_.	Walked all the way across to the back wall .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On any normal mission it would have been .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just wanted you girls to know that I 'm not going to say anything about SOS .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who would be so brazen as to bring the war between Heaven and Hell to Earth ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Sacks crinkled as whoever it was came through the living room and went into the kitchen .
tr	VP_.	Glancing from one to another in confusion .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that 's it .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who wears pearls with sweats ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that 's the problem , too , because Ethan knows me .
tr	S_VP_.	Knowing his last moments on Earth were full of pain and probably confusion .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they stood on a patch of scorched grass , the bell on the ground between them .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	However it seems that China has leaders no more able to look beyond tomorrow than anywhere else in the world .
tr	OTHER	What if the crystal could give me strength ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I moved out of the city and changed my name .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	You obviously know the game .
tr	S_CC_S_.	They said nothing but the implication was unmistakable .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After what seemed to be a very prolonged struggle a fisherman in his boat casually on the way towards the shore sighted me .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What in the world was going on ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet his disclosure was still to be reciprocated .
tr	S_VP_.	Speaking the words made it real .
tr	NP_PP_.	Especially one who is smart and funny and gets what I 'm talking about when I say intellectual property .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It picked up the leash and me I let me drive out .
tr	NP_VP_.	It kept me from being with the one I loved .
tr	OTHER	What if Alethea was telling the truth ?
tr	OTHER	Of you when you were younger .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did those bodiless brains have souls ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now he couldn 't even remember what that had felt like .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was she home ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she leaned back , settling herself between his legs and giving his hands better access to her chest .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Suzi then climbed into a baggy pair of trousers and pulled them over her exoskeleton to hide it .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Saturday night proved to be even better for Lewis .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Lady Gilbert would some day pay for the troubles she had given him .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Why her eyes light up when she dances in the waves .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	'Cause it 's not good for the baby .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The love you shared .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But we must have someone from the inside .
tr	OTHER	Anything to stop the madness .
tr	NP_PP_.	All three of them , if Apollo had done his job , but I wouldn 't find out until Tuck was safe .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would Tye have done if she 'd bumped into him in the dark ?
tr	OTHER	She barely registered as he lay down beside her and then she fell into a deep sleep .
tr	NP_PP_.	The ghost of her troubled girlhood ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'd better not get anywhere near her .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The blue needle initially only made the target drowsy , but after approximately 2 minutes made them lose consciousness for 30 minutes .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Only Harris would be a "" looker "" with character ."
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I probably slept a total of three hours last night .
tr	NP_VP_.	Agnes hadn 't received the decorator 's visit with similar enthusiasm .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though I knew there was no way that I would ever feel fully alive again .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she wasn 't willing to give up , either .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Slowly his smile faded .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Deliberately he reached out , catching her chin with his hand .
tr	NP_VP_.	They stared at the carriage while the dust swirled in the air .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the paramedics came in the room I was still holding her , tears streaming down my face .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he shut the door , no doubt leaning his ear to the outside .
tr	S_CC_S_.	A percussion wave through the deck toppled Greg onto his backside and the ship soared above him .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now the ghost had a name .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she answering a little more cryptically than it seemed ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I kind of thought it was both .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He 's sitting in silence , palms up on his lap , looking into his hands like he 's searching for something he cannot find .
tr	VP_.	Let us rejoice and be glad in it !
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What am I doing ?
tr	NP_PP_.	News of the new and exciting .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he started tapping his foot .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With a thud the door was shut and bolted , as the Monticello 's were the last guests , still awake , to leave .
tr	NP_VP_.	His evasive answer set her teeth on edge .
tr	NP_PP_.	Stop thinking about that .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	In case they have to identify his body she thought wearily .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he wasn 't about to give her away .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I pack everything ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it was just a job to him .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't she just take what he had to offer her ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A newfound happiness and independence she would have thought beyond her reach .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I 'd have an excuse to skip the towel .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it made humans , too ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why is he asking me to go with him in front of everyone ?
tr	S_VP_.	Standing with each girl was one of the Federal 's two managers , Bud Brown and Ollie Weeks .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	There 'd been plenty of other items Annie had requested in Tiffany 's name .
tr	NP_PP_.	Hell of a bad dream .
tr	S_VP_.	Reaching over she grabbed the robe at the foot of her bed .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now there was no one to talk to .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Then why was the only thing on her mind Alexander ?
tr	OTHER	Melinda spun in a circle , the heat still lit inside of her , stripped suddenly away , leaving only cold dread in its wake .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like she wished she was in her pathetic life .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I nearly made some caustic David Carradine remark when he slid his hand down the back of my head .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you really think you were doing it ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Tons and tons of the coco beans , my friend .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it hit him why .
tr	NP_PP_.	Threw over the wall .
tr	NP_VP_.	I was the one who 'd thought coming here tonight was a good idea .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he just cocked his head and smiled .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	First it went up and then started speeding up towards the east .
tr	VP_.	Take our baby , Angie .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'd wait and make my appearance .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know I knew who he was ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I was out to dinner , told him I 'd call him back .
tr	S_CC_S_.	You guys are just scraping by and you fly out for a weekend in Denver .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	No doubt he thought he would never see you again .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he couldn 't push her away .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She stopped well shy of his desk , anger simmering anew at the way he 'd backed her quite literally into a corner earlier .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet the thought of her being so unhappy ripped his heart out .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That evening Glen set the food and glasses out for his guests and took a seat in the kitchen .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	asked Captain Spencer , not realizing until that moment he was quite possessive of his little cage .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever had broken into her house was now out in the hallway , the floorboards groaning under its weight .
tr	OTHER	"Shut your lying m - "" Matteo choked mid-sentence and , letting go of Kiev , fell to his knees ."
tr	OTHER	And what of my aunts ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When would she learn not to get ahead of herself ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Slowly she moved away from him .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Moist and achy and needing .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he referring to the God King and his ability to have her killed ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the most beautiful part of the garden was the roses .
tr	OTHER	What his diagnosis could be .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I walk in casually , with my hoodie , my bag , and my hospital gown .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there 's just one thing standing in her way , this dang imprint .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What Johnny had done would hardly improve his relationship with her mother .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I 'm saying is this , Josh .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When they broke she was captured by those brown eyes .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night was the first time Daemon went cold .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What you two have is too pure to be tainted .
tr	NP_PP_.	Sits on his bed .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then he said , "" Are you nuts ?"
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe he 'd decided that she wasn 't worth the effort , what with her ties to her troublesome brother .
tr	NP_VP_.	He shook his head firmly .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That she 'll never pick up a bottle again because she knows what it does to us .
tr	NP_PP_.	One hell of a mother , huh ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Simply because you possess power does not mean you have to flaunt it .
tr	NP_PP_.	A place of employment .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I leave the room would they hunt me down ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The nosey innkeeper 's wife then went so far as to suggest a visit to a dressmaker .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she supposed to write ?
tr	VP_.	Not looking forward to that conversation .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knew what could happen in half an hour .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now that man was leaving .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Why he deferred to the younger man was a point that inspired much speculation .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Chase 's scent , spicy male soap and outdoors , filled Della 's senses .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What you did , who you were or who you know is no longer important .
tr	VP_.	Bonus stories by William Meikle and John Everson .
tr	NP_VP_.	Spencer slipped the paper into her bag .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his lips came down hard on hers .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least she was safe from him now that she was officially off the market , thanks to Gil .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I was terrified of that kind of rejection and I refused to let my baby be rejected .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because Rhona was not a subtle female and she didn 't know how to read subtle either .
tr	S_CC_S_.	You know , kind of like when someone 's on parole and there 's an officer to make sure the rules are being followed .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it was a garage door , freshly installed .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What are you doing ?
tr	VP_.	Don 't speak at all until Callum tells you that you can .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Which pissed me off immensely , because Niko is the best husband and father a person could ask for .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After printing out the form he looked over it one more time just to make sure everything was in order .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the McGill became quiet .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He just wished he knew what was going on .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They al stared in the bright sunlight at the sleek beauty of the weapon .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As they set off the night shadows darkened around the old stables .
tr	S_VP_.	Being polite at the moment didn 't feel right .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there were more strange and totally inexplicable effects to come .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Interesting that when her clothing choices were subdued , she 'd choose something so loud for the garments she expected to remain unseen .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	There was something there she didn 't know about .
tr	VP_.	More than one , in fact .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing him drink made me wonder if there was ever an hour he went by without drinking .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way she 'd leaned against him on the bus , glowing with warmth like the last ember of a fire .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Opening the fridge he saw the lines on the milk and the monitoring of the fridge .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I moan and he growls , releasing my breast then attacking my other nipple while his fingers roll and pull the one he just left .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Once before he 'd pointed out the differences in their abilities .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Since the effects are psychological then one placebo may not be exactly like another .
tr	VP_.	""" What about you ?"
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She seldom goes out .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Our laughter began to slowly die down and we were left grinning at each other .
tr	OTHER	Or there could already be more and we just hadn 't discovered them .
tr	OTHER	He couldn 't help but laugh at that .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then her implant beeped softly in her ear .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As he did the sound of a siren came up the hill and around the corner came an ambulance followed by a Park Ranger truck .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And there 's nothing I can do to prove to you that those memories are real .
tr	NP_PP_.	Looks toward the wall .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For now you will go to your quarters .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she said yes .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just didn 't understand what you said .
tr	NP_PP_.	Home to Jamie and his new life .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she had said in the shack had been true .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As long as the symbolism , the center of story , is satisfied .
tr	OTHER	And rising with the hailstorm came the Angel .
tr	NP_PP_.	Nothing compared to the emotion that wrapped itself around her heart when she thought about Steve on this tour .
tr	VP_.	slipping and splashing down into the slime .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she watched , through Jamie 's eyes , as he fell before the people that she knew were his parents .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did you think ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How does he manage to order me around without ceasing , yet refusing always seems unreasonable ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't she love him ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't he understand ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Or was it she who didn 't know what was too far ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Usually I could lose myself in that for hours .
tr	S_VP_.	Talking and bonding with Kevin had been almost more moving than making love .
tr	OTHER	For A Limited Time get Temptation Road 3 FREE , when you purchase Temptation Road 2 !
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing her upset unnerved me now .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he hurt in the wagon crash ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you hear gunfire ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that would be exactly what I 'd do .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Or we could stay in ou and watch TV if you 're not up to it .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But times had changed .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From there they caught a ride to New Plymouth .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she realized that Elizabeth had attacked the school , too , which meant she was springing all her traps at once .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	You guys already went to college and graduated with your degrees .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that was considering they had increased the time intervals to regressing three years per day .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And somewhere amid one of those oceans was a madcap heiress he was professionally obligated to find .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it wasn 't business hours .
tr	NP_PP_.	Two kilometers between us and daylight .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that 's breakfast .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Usually spell will wear out after few years on child , less on adult .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Tonight he 'd come to her rescue .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much had happened since they had set off that morning that Jenna had forgotten why they went in the first place .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she forget to turn her phone off for the night ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	There were hundreds of them , nothing you 'd choose for a lazy afternoon at the beach .
tr	NP_VP_.	He had to be freezing .
tr	NP_PP_.	Magic of Hollywood and all .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he wasn 't interested in fair .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she looked up .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Skye almost flew off the bed .
tr	S_VP_.	Trying to maintain any kind of balance between work and taking care of his father was one big blur .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then her tongue emerged , licking at the liquid before it could reach her lips .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really need help ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After finally getting Jasmine to lay in bed with me I convince her to give me a back rub .
tr	OTHER	Bad enough I had to come here at all .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When are you free ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it 's also sickeningly sweet and too much gives me a splitting headache .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In between meat plates were dishes of multi-coloured salads and vegetables that I had never laid eyes upon before .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Meanwhile she stared at him as if he were the pond scum who wanted to steal everything she held dear .
tr	NP_VP_.	She threw her backpack like a basketball , pushing away from her chest .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What am I doing ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it 's all worth it in the end .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For a long minute nothing happened .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	You almost had me until you took it that far .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	but now I wonder if I was the one who had no heart .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The tension in the room skyrocketed and since my head was still between my knees , I couldn 't interpret the silent communication .
tr	S_VP_.	"sounded horribly false , as though he "" d got them from a book ."
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But - A twig snapped behind him .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That way it was easier to kick out whoever it was .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For this mission you aren 't likely to see too many trafficking victims .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he turn down her accountant without knowing the fellow 's qualifications ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet her curiosity overrode common sense .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It passed by an escort frigate eight miles to its starboard unnoticed , twenty minutes later it acquired the aircraft carrier through its infrared sensor .
tr	NP_VP_.	It leaned over and watched the water drip from its structure .
tr	NP_VP_.	Hitting something sounded good .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he is still a viscount .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she has a vested interest in making sure that any trouble Vaughn is in disappears .
tr	NP_PP_.	Risking life for just a rush ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he 'd felt that before .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then silence surrounds us .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Maintaining their grip of the audience the band drew everyone deeper still .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was there something he had overlooked ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The next morning he awoke to the sizzle and smell of scrambled eggs and bacon .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Maybe he didn 't realize she had found out yet Maybe he had some reason for continuing the charade .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she had to look them in the eyes and lie to them .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the other three Ricky figures were running , too .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	His phone call last night had confirmed it .
tr	NP_VP_.	Cars jammed the parking lot and lined the curbs of Greenway and Main .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Surely he wouldn 't hurt this gentle vampire or the woman he loved .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But finally he did find some remnant of control , enough to allow him to turn off the water and haul her out of the tub .
tr	OTHER	What if some creepy stalker had been watching me ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Mount Olympus really exist ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Why hadn 't he stayed ?
tr	OTHER	But tonight they wouldn 't .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He turned his back and walked away in the direction he had come from , as though nothing at all had happened .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Even Pa got choked up .
tr	VP_.	Figure out what they are getting out of it .
tr	S_CC_S_.	There was a post office right here and a Starbucks on this side .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I let the familiarity stand without elbowing him in the gut .
tr	NP_PP_.	Out here in the open .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he felt a large mass check him into the lockers .
tr	OTHER	* * * In the city of London Johnny and Liz got on well .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Occasionally Hugh wished he 'd be more forward physically but knew Haworth would be appalled at the idea of a servant seducing his master .
tr	VP_.	Don 't hurt her .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She never wanted to leave the pool .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way they do when they don 't really know what to say .
tr	S_CC_S_.	There was no evidence of any human activity and many birds were present , but no other animals .
tr	S_VP_.	Sleeping on the sofa sucked when the woman he wanted waited warm and willing up a flight of stairs .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Instead he urged Victoria to follow him down a darker path .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I always thought I would die on my feet .
tr	S_VP_.	Having to squat down for long periods of time caused her legs to hurt so badly .
tr	OTHER	They were kind eyes but I also had the feeling that they were eyes that had seen a lot and not all of it was good .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he want a kiss ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The thought of that touching her again ... no .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	First a row of pine cupboards momentarily sprouted tentacles , then the brick of the fireplace .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she did work for the government recovering information .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What it 's like , being a wolf .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I 'll let you know when you can talk to her .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the Muslim community gathers they offer collective prayers for the forgiveness of the dead .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All afternoon I wonder what it means .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If I had not been in the new part of faerie Taranis could not have taken me .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He shouldered the travel bag and they walked from the park to the boulevard beyond .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	That Conrad 's teeth miraculously had grown to their huge proportions all on their own ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Suspicion of murder ."
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I was a kid I opened a can of cranberry glob , slid it out , and cut it into the shape of a kidney .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What you told me is much different than what I had assumed .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So am I. I just believe that in his eagerness to achieve them , my grandfather can trust too soon .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The horn was the signal that one observer had gone on to a better place and another would replace him .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then her mouth left his lips and trailed down to his neck .
tr	OTHER	So suddenly did he stand , his chair clattered to the floor beneath him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Standing with her back to the counter she scanned the open space of the library for help .
tr	OTHER	Now that you 're home .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I will be loyal and true to you above all others .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He also wanted to have a word with Derek Butterfield .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Kyle , Joseph and Rick you 're my choices for that task .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment I wonder if we were mistaken , if these are her children and mean her no harm .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had he managed to survive the shaft collapsing ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She just couldn 't stop smiling .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was he supposed to handle this ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he laughed , a harsh sound in the stillness of the night , and left the shack .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time I smiled .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Noah pleaded with his brother and I held my hand up and waved it .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because it 's what brought me to Logan .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even the most famous and celebrated stars have led lives of deep depression , broken families and misery .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just as the thought danced through my mind he wrapped his arm around me and pulled me close .
tr	OTHER	Can 't you be a little more original with your insults ?
tr	NP_VP_.	James Dean dragged the bag over beside his Mama and picked up the now empty paper bag on her other side .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did he not come to her for relief from his demon ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But circumstances had changed .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they tried to say some nonsense about a docking fee .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Her instincts were telling her he was completely genuine .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he explored her .
tr	VP_.	Let me find your file .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you wish to eat it you must feed it .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When they got outside Eduard was coming down the track with a crossbow in each hand and a pouch of bolts in his belt .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Just kind of recreationally it seemed to me .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If someone will see you there , is going to believe you go there to do that .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Go back and change into the clothes I left in the bushes for you .
tr	OTHER	Cathy fixed her eyes on her mother and continued up until finally she was in her mother 's arms half laughing and half crying .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where are the sweepers ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just knew that the lady who played the piano , and who my uncle occasionally smiled upon , turned out to be our neighbor .
tr	S_CC_S_.	One had its mouth open with scary teeth and the other was actually foaming and frothing .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just know I don 't want some hotshot thinking he can put Diana at risk the way he did last night .
tr	VP_.	Listen to my grandpa 's radio program about the price of hogs ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he feel responsible for others , as he did for his drunken father ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so it seemed that they had discovered a way to escape the monstrous plant 's belly .
tr	NP_VP_.	The embrace wasn 't one of a lover , though .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He was dirty and in need of a drink , he bowed low to the Governor .
tr	S_CC_S_.	They stared into each other 's eyes from across the room and it was as if everyone had disappeared and they were the only two there .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We are strongest together and we are weakest apart .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And suddenly I wasn 't okay with the plan I 'd put into place .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he smothers me in a kiss that makes me forget we are in a public place .
tr	OTHER	Just who is it that is suffering from strange visions ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was that supposed to make any sense ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He looked around him .
tr	NP_VP_.	Brody opened his eyes , spearing me with the molten chocolate of his irises .
tr	NP_PP_.	The beginning of my never-ending life .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there was Mira .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But behind them walked him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he did , more fervently .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I was aggravated at how slowly she had made me walk while she was in her old lady costume .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Her body already hot and wet and hungry for his .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he looked back at Travis .
tr	OTHER	Now if only she could convince her body to do the same .
tr	NP_PP_.	The father of my baby .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he broke my little girl .
tr	OTHER	Some things frightened Altair , it was true - but nothing the slave master was capable of , that much he knew .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she couldn 't do a thing about it .
tr	S_VP_.	To head in the direction of the open water gave her such headaches she fell to her knees , blood pouring from every orifice of her head .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I do believe is that he knows who Chloe Houston was expecting .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Alex and Zia were the two I feared the most and now that they have been ruled out I feel like I can breathe a little easier .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The extreme emotion triggered the static that rushed over my skin so fast I couldn 't stop it .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With her limited number of followers on Twitter and her small group of Facebook friends it had been a miracle that Abi had heard about the stranger .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Nate 's tone that night made it sound as if he didn 't care if she was dating someone or not .
tr	OTHER	No pictures or anything bad from you .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I will discharge you .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was he to know that Grover would make a change of plans ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And all at once Benny had spent his Spirit .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why wouldn 't they be ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he swung down and began running .
tr	NP_PP_.	A future with no barriers .
tr	S_VP_.	Being babied by Holly Colter would make anyone feel better .
tr	NP_VP_.	I felt like I needed to step into a freezer to cool the hell off .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I shut up before he became angry with me , knowing he 'd find out the hard way .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she was prepared nevertheless .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the light coalesced like thick gelatin around her face .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Five minutes later she returned with a tray of coffee , some biscuits and Ms Bennett .
tr	NP_VP_.	She hugged me and pulled me down next to her .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How are you holding up ?
tr	NP_PP_.	One of the doomed groups .
tr	OTHER	""" Not right at nine ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From the corner of his eye Guy watched her intercept a tall , well-built stranger .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I knew who had done it and I guess I expected something like this .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I had in my memory card was all from Dave who downloaded these songs for me to play when I get bored or scared .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I 'm strangling on my pain and the aching , painful breaths my body doesn 't quite know what to do with anymore .
tr	VP_.	Leave a note and let her sleep .
tr	S_VP_.	Thinking about it makes it feel like someone dropped two tons of dirt on my chest that I wasn 't expecting .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It wasn 't what she wanted to hear .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I locked guy nature away too tightly .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How were prayers supposed to feed an empty belly ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He will agree to plea out to a lower assault charge .
tr	NP_PP_.	Sat astride his daughter 's legs .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She immediately regretted shouting .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All these years I promised I 'd never do it .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	More than you should be .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Other times they moved stiffly around each other as if they had never even met .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 19 It was him .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not a name one would usually associate with a contract killer .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Looking at Scorch she saw the paleness of his face .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How I felt left out and left behind .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he didn 't have the faintest idea how to love someone , laugh with someone , or share his life .
tr	S_VP_.	Being only a few minutes late for his lunch appointment meant that he 'd missed the window of lighter traffic .
tr	OTHER	Does your face hurt ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	To Jerome it meant finding gold in the dung heap ; beauty in the dark tremors of humanity 's struggle .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just stood there and watched the whole awful scene unfold .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I knew he 'd texted her , that he 'd sought her out in the months I 'd been gone .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would she want to wait another day ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What are you talking about , every kid ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it 'll be all right !
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he say those exact words ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If she said ' no ' what would he do for his wife ?
tr	VP_.	Just wondering if you 're ok .
tr	VP_.	t you listening to me ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	"Gabe only lived on the fringes of "" spook world "" and rarely came close to physical danger ."
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She also went through his desk and found a book of poetry .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why has Sofie left me like this ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I read over it again .
tr	VP_.	Forget about everything for a moment ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Which do you want first ?
tr	NP_PP_.	All in a day 's work , really .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With an effort she pulled back from him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In fact he could almost feel them himself .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he slipped away .
tr	S_CC_S_.	An unexpected feeling of loss washed over her and she couldn 't speak .
tr	NP_PP_.	The leader of the pack .
tr	NP_PP_.	Hard floor beneath me .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He yanks me along and I am stunned enough to allow him for a moment before I resist .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If only she could just tell him she couldn 't pick a damn restaurant because she didn 't know any around here .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What kept Lea going was her determination to keep fighting for Julie .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Lots of different ones ."
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Without this class how would I graduate ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Not a single hand goes up among the jury .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes we have a ' down time ' when we can .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who could blame her ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's his major ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the beeswax was wrong with her ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today we decided to see if the city was any better on the other side of the river .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So these do mark us in some way .
tr	S_VP_.	Turns out we manage to arouse the suspicions of no one as we make our way to the minivan where Brielle is already waiting .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I couldn 't ignore what going back to Davidson would mean for me .
tr	NP_VP_.	I pull away from his kiss , slip out of his arms , and take three steps back .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How would she find Johnnie 's room ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From the very beginning I watched you : grade school , vacations , chicken pox , girls , and law school .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But you know we 're almost night and day different .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where were my Nikes ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What new things would I learn about her now that I had a mind not inhibited by magic ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Kellan lifted his chin , feeling the reply like a volley lobbed at him broadside .
tr	OTHER	Was I acting like Nan ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He almost laughed when he saw her face .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would she not tell the police immediately ?
tr	OTHER	But he hadn 't been able to outrun the void in the past and he knew it wouldn 't accomplish anything now .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he not notice she was there ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Talk about coming out of left field .
tr	S_VP_.	Maybe organizing her stuff would make her life feel a little bit more under control .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it hurt .
tr	NP_VP_.	The smile at the corners of his eyes set off a wildfire in Caroline 's middle .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Just then a woman walked into the room .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When his dad arrived Mrs Rankin left and headed back to school .
tr	NP_VP_.	The only option we had was to wait and hope for another van to come along .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she pulled back her arm and threw the sword she held directly at his head .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It all started after my attack with some self-defense classes .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I mention that Jesse is finally talking to me again ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	I myself once lived in a cannibal village for a time , and found some The natives ... were pleasant enough people .
tr	NP_PP_.	Almost out of juice .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that 's why Henry didn 't want me in the hotel room that night .
tr	OTHER	""" Not even a teaspoonful ."
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did any of the others understand what was really happening here ?
tr	VP_.	Dank I hadn 't seen Pagan in three days .
tr	NP_PP_.	One in a drenched white T-shirt that clings to every ridge of his chest .
tr	S_VP_.	Trying not to worry she took Calvin to bed where they talked and cuddled until finally Calvin drifted into restful slumber .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's going on ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With one swift bite he had created two puncture wounds .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a cloud of smoke and squealing wheels it took off in the opposite direction .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Being one of seven siblings she found inspiration all around .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that was her strategy .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The mirror showed the real world and it looked like he was looking at some maidens near an ocean .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was with true gladness I came to our little lists .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Claire watched them shimmy above the table as she sat in April 's kitchen , awaiting the glass of iced tea April had offered her .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The satellites that hook the entire world together will be the targeting devices .
tr	NP_VP_.	She battled back the tears as she pushed him away .
tr	NP_VP_.	he asked her , thinking they might have a private few minutes walking , at least .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would that man think of her ?
tr	OTHER	A coin that would probably feed her for several months if she sold it ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Most days they 're one and the same in the burn unit .
tr	OTHER	But so did the steam .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today you 'll pay everything !
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he reined in his anger , remained where he was and questioned Mathews instead .
tr	NP_PP_.	Stay in one place ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What emerged from the tunnel was a sight that Willow would never forget .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you are not for the freedom of ancient people then you do not have reason to breathe air on this planet .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They usually left late when they hung out .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he doing ?
tr	NP_PP_.	No word from Jake .
tr	NP_VP_.	Another volley , close enough this time that several British soldiers in the front lines fell , knocked down by musket fire .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she had not done it for pleasure -- all for gain .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I shouldn 't have listened to Boggs , because he might have been in some delusional death state .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In fact she seemed to have gained much in dignity and self-possession , but stood meekly enough while her father addressed her .
tr	S_VP_.	Being around a large group like that tended to make me a little jittery .
tr	OTHER	In the basement on Harrington Lane .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Major Bonham , surprised by the unfolding scene , simply froze in his tracks .
tr	NP_VP_.	Gran reached up to help but couldn 't do much wearing her fake purple fingernails .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How bare that possibility was he knew only too well .
tr	NP_PP_.	A big huge thanks to you and to my fans .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'd spent an hour or more inside the same room .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Josh told me , anyway .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Bubba was a summa cum laude graduate from MIT and was without a doubt the smartest man Nick had ever met .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the center of it all was the egg 's recent occupant .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	My actions that night are unexplainable .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What returned to her was a level of arousal that astonished her .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he going to do when the cold light of tomorrow dawned ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he did do it .
tr	VP_.	Don 't share anything with anyone , absolutely no one .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he saying that he wasn 't really saying ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She carefully leaned back in her chair with her mug and crossed her legs as she let out a sigh .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the orders have changed .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he get such a quick response from her ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just once , I 'd like for someone to tell me I did a good job , too .
tr	VP_.	"have too much going on to be a good ... "" A good what ?"
tr	S_CC_S_.	She realized all of a sudden that the guy was actually taking this better than she expected and she didn 't know how to react to it .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She then saw Ian in the opposite corner .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	* * * Flavio studied the electronic reports he 'd received from contacts in the U.S. .
tr	S_VP_.	Just thinking back about the hospital was a bad idea .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it was with great relief that he opened the door and went into his modest flat .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really deserve to die like that ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely he wouldn 't speak , not at a time like this .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Cereal I Two children ( A1 and A3 ) stand eating a bowl of Trix .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Without Edwin 's identity he couldn 't exact his revenge personally either .
tr	OTHER	Probably just a result of exhaustion and loss of blood anyway .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Verity sighed and sank down onto the chair Tavi had ignored .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But immediately our mouths dropped open with shock .
tr	NP_VP_.	You have the money to go to art school and study .
tr	NP_VP_.	She was excited , as she had solved some mystery .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then they 'd never see each other again .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he was a lone wolf without a pack or family and no interest in one .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The beast violently shook its head back and forth , yanking on the hunter 's leg in an attempt to drag him away .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then a scream rent the stones .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not a one was out lazing in the sun or grazing on the short grass .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she 'd get a new place , a new job , and prove to herself that she could stand on her own .
tr	NP_PP_.	A man who was capable of doing anything if provoked the wrong way .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes the man was just too sweet .
tr	VP_.	Includes the Makers series where children control the elements , as well as more tales of magic , romance , and the paranormal .
tr	OTHER	Do you want me to come over ?
tr	VP_.	Didn 't know that he 'd turned away from her because of his own guilt .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Colin didn 't plan to use George as a role model , other than taking note of the older Were 's obvious physical fitness .
tr	S_VP_.	To have heard myself making it was to be answered .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why else would the High Lord know who he was ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever was driving hadn 't gained enough momentum after clearing the corner to reach the legal limit .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I 'm not sure where they 're buried ' he added as an afterthought .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he failing , and if so , what was happening to those humans ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before I came here last night I went to see my uncle .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I 'd thought he was referring to everything I 'd seen from my abilities .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The boy still said nothing .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did she want ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I only have to tell him what I myself willed to happen and that I asked others to make it happen .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe he has something to hide .
tr	OTHER	But this weekend she 'd been paying plenty of attention to me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I also know Mr. Middleton is her real father .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Not unless you could remember to knock the wedge out on your way back through !
tr	OTHER	It couldn 't be his mother but yet it appeared to be her .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they offer up their nubile bodies and provide him the pleasures of the flesh I could not ?
tr	OTHER	Even if she wasn 't .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As the line was reeled in Kermit 's body was twisted so he was forced to face the boat .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And our breed was such a loving breed .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I tossed the stone and it hit , without so much as a splash .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One that has the services and security we 'll need to properly start governing from day one .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Slowly she began reading again .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he was the kind of boy that literally never took a bad picture and looked good in everything so it didn 't really matter .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Everytime he came back into the apartment to move something else his eyes found me .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did he keep acting like we worked together ?
tr	VP_.	Damn them for being right .
tr	S_VP_.	Playing for about a hour a day was their daily routine .
tr	S_VP_.	Being alone with the Captain scared her .
tr	OTHER	And then without thinking he began singing with them the low , deep , resonant sound of AUM .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she really just say that ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I heard the high-pitched squeal of two shots .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then he thought it might be worth the risk .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He slowly ran the arrow along the bow four times , then slid it back into his quiver without looking .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would be waiting beyond it ?
tr	VP_.	Drive back home and forget about ever knowing me .
tr	OTHER	Things with nuts and things without nuts .
tr	NP_VP_.	The room fell silent .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For his part Sion detested his stepfather , and resented the fact that his mother 's affections were wasted on him .
tr	NP_VP_.	His jaw was clenched so tightly that she could practically hear his teeth grinding together as his fingers nimbly undid the knots William had tied .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she look different ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Tilting her head she saw a foot long gouge along with decade-old cigarette burns and a hand sized patch of matted skin .
tr	NP_PP_.	No point in risking a flash of the Maglite beam .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As she spoke she turned the doorknob .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Give me the gun and we can talk about this on the way to the police station .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once her favorite stone , in fact , but her birthday had become synonymous with death and destruction and , well , she 'd decided emeralds sucked .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there was something strange about the light tonight .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I can guarantee that this is not true !
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he let your mother go ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He just hoped she never knew the extent of it .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But even they looked just as confused and frightened as she felt .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it her imagination or did they exchange triumphant looks ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only I can see her .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He took of his coat and I hung it in the closet .
tr	VP_.	Let 's get this veil on you and get you down that aisle .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I bear into her with everything I am .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She usually wore white , black , gray or silver .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I unlocked the door and we stepped inside .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't she just wait ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One moment he was gentle , looking at me like I was the most precious thing in the world .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	* * * * Zoe sat in front of her bookshelf , flipping rapidly through every magic book she owned .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps she was crazy , after all .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even the masonry levels could easily be converted into the laser pulse rifles demonstrated in The Ark Lords as part of the Jack Henry saga .
tr	NP_VP_.	Steve didn 't comment back , thought about asking Jay how he felt about attacking the government directly but thought better of it .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He took his time dramatically running over to me , tripping on everything his feet could find to trip on .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Work and school just keeps us busy .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 9 Colt I couldn 't believe that I had pulled off everything without a hitch .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't she just tell me about it ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And there isn 't really anything you or anybody can say to make me feel better about what happened to my mother .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I was a realtor .
tr	NP_PP_.	Perfect in a man 's hand .
tr	OTHER	Do you hear me ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the world didn 't actually explode .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Hearing him say that reminded me of the many times he 'd untied a halter dress I was wearing .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it will be up to us to remember .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Or there 'll be a whole string of accidents that end up causing the same tiling .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did I do ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If the person out there who wanted me dead had anything to say about it .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I want to save Piper ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she felt his hands at her face .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	After the conference was over the Director returned to his office and talked to Eve .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Something , anything , to put my mind at ease after the whispers in the changing rooms that blamed the Scottish curse .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I explain it all ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes we come here to get cars .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Thankfully I got another customer and didn 't have to listen to any more of the conversation .
tr	NP_PP_.	Most of the time .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't she be soft as well as successful ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It just makes me feel more like I made a really good decision in coming here .
tr	OTHER	Now there was only an emptiness , a despair so deep it covered his soul like the slime mold was covering his wings .
tr	VP_.	Wanted him to feel it .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Some nights Lauren remembered that her mother was sick , that alcoholism was a disease .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But flowers were very ordinary .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it dropped as he and Adri squared up .
tr	NP_VP_.	He 'd laid himself down before God and pleaded with everything in him that his wife be healed .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I can breathe again I open it and fish around till I find the box with the bandages .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though , Sarah decided to remain an extra day because little Grace had a stomachache after the get-together .
tr	NP_PP_.	Any hope for normalcy .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course she 'd stayed .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For almost a quarter of an hour Fernando sat unaware of his surroundings lost in painful memories .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I know that I need to be faster than this .
tr	NP_PP_.	Nothing compared to where her father lived .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least they were watching her pretty intently .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even his stride was angry .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Gaston didn 't make sense and he was too dangerous of a mystery for her to even consider tackling .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now it was mine to decide what to do with .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The children were all in bed and Douglas felt that any responsible guardian should have long since returned , preferably around six .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Hands trembling , heart pounding , she looked for the fallen shopping bags and her purse .
tr	NP_PP_.	The guilt of lying to my boss and putting my job on the line , all for nothing .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But maybe he meant Emma 's lies about being Sutton .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If his panther buddies could see him now .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why on earth do I do this to myself ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like I 'd do that to him ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe Sebastian had the right idea .
tr	S_CC_S_.	"The door opened again and the guard shouted , "" All out !"
tr	NP_PP_.	Big white place on the hill ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although keeping Quinlan fed also required nourishment .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As we approached the warehouse a few people emerged from the shadows .
tr	S_VP_.	Feeling her tits up against me was part of the addiction I 'd developed .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Blood rushed to her head and her mind was heavy .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that wouldn 't protect me against a venereal disease .
tr	NP_PP_.	The beginning of a new era .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What should she do now ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Mikey eyes Micha 's Chevelle and there 's a nervous look in his eyes .
tr	OTHER	And what would his rich and famous friends and clients think of me ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he says go .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How many times had I imagined this , what it 'd be like to touch her ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Since he didn 't know how much she could handle he took an easier route .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she expect to be named anything special ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Not that I have a lot of experience , but I don 't think any man can kiss like Sam .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We have enough men to do this and it will make them split their defenses .
tr	S_CC_S_.	This is my life and she is but a piece of it .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I didn 't .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I put the drink down and I couldn 't help but smile .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The hospital he was to be admitted to , the story that would be told .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe I did .
tr	NP_PP_.	A woman off the streets , no less .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I needed to learn how to clear my head with Jack in the picture instead of pushing him out of it .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she 'd begun to read the reverend 's pocket Bible , which Madeline had dropped off at the station the day before .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment he thought he had calmed her .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Why hadn 't she said they should go to Jace 's room ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But somehow he thought his life would add up to more .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I must take more notice of the colours the next time I 'm looking for someone , to check .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she leave a man like this ?
tr	S_VP_.	Holding onto some ties to my past , as much as I 'm not really that guy anymore , will keep me grounded .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Nikki had gone out early .
tr	NP_VP_.	He 'd been here three days and hadn 't gotten laid yet .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now the entire town was in on the act .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I was excited .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did one face her missing heart , knowing she would have to lose it again ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell did she have to be angry about ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course the baby was his .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With a smile he withdrew silently and turned his steps toward Finan 's tent , beginning to whistle a merry tune to himself .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Two guards are stationed outside each doorway and one is in the kitchen itself watching her .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Arron finally broke their spat .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The next week he stopped a runaway carriage .
tr	NP_PP_.	The two women inside seemingly noticed nothing .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Something she hadn 't expected .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why wasn 't the damn thing opening ?
tr	VP_.	Slept most of the day .
tr	NP_PP_.	Play bingo at his feet !
tr	S_NP_VP_.	His fingers still gave her every bit of pleasure he could wring out of her .
tr	VP_.	Fight it , Iseo , pray for deliverance .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By Saturday I would be ready to go get a job and an apartment .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he and Sara seemed to be her saving grace daily .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because I 'd rather track down Snow with those two than without them .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he think Rick walked like a cowboy , too ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why should she tell him anything when she hadn 't bought into the game ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But none of them said anything about vampires living there .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the breathing stopped .
tr	OTHER	But it also appeared as though some had gone back and chosen something more ... appropriate .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is it about Mona ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	It meant so much to me that he liked what I did and I made him proud .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he value her happiness above his own ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Ten in bad weather or with minor injuries .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's his name ?
tr	S_VP_.	Getting Nicole to connect with him again had cost him a lot of money .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I 'll never be able to pull you up and I doubt you 're in any condition to attempt a climb even with the rope .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now he was nowhere to be seen .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That he 'd moved my armoire into his closet .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even if I convinced him I was not a spy he might want to keep me in the Castle to tend his sick soldiers .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	"If I can make it worth your while not to publish it ... "" "" Hold on ."
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he looked at me rather sternly .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She can deny everything and she certainly wouldn 't have the two books where they might be found by the police .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How am I supposed to swap it with the vial in my pocket without the doctor noticing ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now the words of The Little Engine That Could became slower and more laboured with each passing footfall .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One we can both live with .
tr	VP_.	Be careful with whom you entrust your secrets .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I slam on brakes I get twenty noses up my ass .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that was good news .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it didn 't make sense .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it possible using teleportation had aggravated the wound in his body ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did I agree to this ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Ahead of him he could see an island .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where is Ong 's Hat ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Devon knew that they had finally come upon some of the carnage they had smelled .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Rather than a bomb there stood a bombshell in the form of a beautiful woman .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps it was something between thunderous laughing and crying .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she was doing was something that a vampire was not supposed to do .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course with that much talent she had also been the scriptwriter .
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting in the pew a few rows ahead of him were two characters who suddenly stood out from the rest .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	As long as she owed him wishes she was free of her watery prison .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had he said ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Back outside he gathers his composure before setting his sights on the floating room in the distance .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	There we were , alone in the dark , like we were years before , except I was the only virgin in the room .
tr	S_VP_.	Being a healer is harder than being a Huntress .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Why she was flustered by him suggesting they sleep together was a mystery .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Dennis sat back , eyes glistening with happy tears he was too proud to shed .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If only my boomerang hadn 't fallen I could 've hit him on the head .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she asked him the last time he 'd seen Riley the lie slid easily off his tongue .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a few weeks he , or she , will be fully formed , just have a lot of growing left to do .
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting in some cold box with no communications , but as far as I knew she was fine .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can anyone be expected to work in our modern world if they do not believe in evolution ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Dropping into a lower gear she pushed hard , determined not to be humiliated .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How many times had she picked up the phone to call him ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The fire pops and sizzles with the sap from the branches they found .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Why walking through a crowd sends me into a panic attack .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every single game she had ever played against him , by the way .
tr	OTHER	He was a gifted builder my dad , he built our house in Thomas Street , but somehow , I could not interest myself in wood .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Dillon suggested that they all get together at a fine restaurant near the hotel for dinner .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they all heard what she was desperately afraid of .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The next morning I awoke to a tongue in my ear and something hard pressing into my back .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If it had been stronger , perhaps , but even then the outcome would be questionable .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she led them through the knee-high dead weeds of a vacant lot to a street that was poorly lighted and utterly silent .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there was silence .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now I was terrified .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For just a few moments he had felt totally helpless .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Behind her a uniformed man with short black hair slides down an access ladder , thumping his large combat boots onto the metal deck .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With frenzy he screamed .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The rain was getting heavier and the emergency personnel now seemed impatient to get the job done and return to their respective home bases .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Opening the corral gate she stopped in front of a white stallion , offering him one of the vegetables she had brought .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If Richard had been right about the meeting going well , talking to Vincent could sabotage our efforts rather than help .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I immediately head to the back of the room .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What are you doing working here ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Leaving tore at her and she turned away from him so he wouldn 't see the sorrow in her eyes .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I always sell my baked goods at a booth next to the snack bar and donate the proceeds to the athletic program .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we walked through a forest without the wolves I pretended to look for .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Mason sent a quick message to Helen informing her he had acquired his target .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the most part it was a wonderful experience .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he was glad for the chance to be alone , behind the wheel of the car , on the dark , deserted roads .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he finally found what he was waiting for a very long time .
tr	VP_.	Beware , for I am fearless and therefore powerful .
tr	S_VP_.	Selling the ploy had already cost one life and might cost two more .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he ever really love me ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I ended up spoiling everything .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I whispered softly and she gasped and her eyes lit up .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes I can 't find the answers , either .
tr	NP_PP_.	Another tightening on the sword .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why must I ask and compel them to comment upon it ?
tr	NP_VP_.	His teeth are sharp , his lips a deep red .
tr	NP_PP_.	My hearts races at the prospect .
tr	S_VP_.	Being with an older man changed all of that .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Not that I cared much once it began .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I started to make my plans , but decided to wait until we arrived here to set them in motion .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he and Aunt Clara devise this plan together ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they charged , galloping wildly towards his waiting line of men .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	As soon as he was gone Tom addressed the others .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And there he was , tall and built , looking more clean-cut than he used to in a long-sleeved thermal and black jeans .
tr	S_VP_.	Just looking at him in all of his gorgeousness was enough to please me .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Only when more hunters and dogs arrived did I run off .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now Aran was afraid .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Up ahead was a site that he had been avoiding .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The two mountains took their positions by the door and Lauren closed the door with a sharp bang .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had Chase found out ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did I steal from Grandpa 's friend ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she tell him not to feel guilty when guilt consumed her as well ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometime later the vibration of the motor stopped .
tr	NP_PP_.	Talk casually to a man who 'd violated her privacy only hours before ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Past security and into the Pit we went , keeping a good distance between us .
tr	VP_.	Wanted to go to bed and bury her face in the covers .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today it took her half an hour or even longer .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I mention firm ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I didn 't understand was how the main parachute could come out if the pilot chute didn 't .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Within the building there are a load of flunkies and aimless guards who can be snuck past or fought as the PCs wish .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that make me uncomfortable ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean they hadn 't started ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That third year was tough .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Two minutes later he was asleep .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At one end was the ongoing construction , and at the other end were the tables , chairs , condiments table , and the kitchen .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she to do ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She let the drape fall back in place and attempted to make sense of everything she saw .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I can 't be empty without you .
tr	VP_.	Except when it came to his job .
tr	S_VP_.	Turning she pulled the bed sheet from the bed .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why wouldn 't he just start his usual tirade , include a warning or two , and get it over and done with ?
tr	S_VP_.	Being this close to her felt right .
tr	VP_.	Didn 't stop him from grabbing her hand before she regained enough of her wits to shut the door in his face .
tr	NP_PP_.	Three days of waking up to the attentions of the king .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was she fooling ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Only this time she was older .
tr	NP_PP_.	More like an action man .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I also needed to wipe the last ten minutes from my memory and I had a feeling that was going to take a bit of time .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Instead he threw his arms around her , holding her tightly to him .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	"How do you -- "" I remembered her mental perception gift ."
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they laugh and cry ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The unhappy consequences of bad choices .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he had not been able to bring himself to throw it away .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I saw in the gym was all the men lining up on one side .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the plans had to be about this land , this continent .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely there would be some future generations of humans that would want to know what some of us went through .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	"He himself just called her "" girl "" because that was what she was ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I typed : Are you sure you 're ready to give him another chance ?
tr	OTHER	Is it possible to modify a gun to shoot aspen stakes ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did bones reconnect ?
tr	S_VP_.	Probably got caught up in the chase .
tr	NP_PP_.	My rebel in a suit .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he have forgotten that Dianna was one of them ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Some evinced a great fear of Christianity and the strife it would cause among others .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But a sneaky part of me enjoyed knowing things about him that they didn 't .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you hear what I said ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Only when we heard the grinding of stone on stone did we stop and look back .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knew food shopping could be so fraught with sexual connotation ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That you 've been here before ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That he could trust .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Conrad chimed in .
tr	OTHER	Not with the way things happened .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What could one little stroking possibly hurt ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I started my car .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And here he managed to insert a smile without help from Moshe or from his notes .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he placed another deputy of his -- another Pope , to whom the ones who have abandoned the Roman Church can turn .
tr	NP_PP_.	That sort of thing .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But eviction involved arbitration rarely favoring the landlord .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who shall I try and summon ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really not know that I expected him to stick up for me no matter who was there ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I really hate the mayor that much that I would want to hurt Maddie as well ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I 'd wanted him to be more like Nash when , in reality , he was Nash .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It never occurred to me that they might want more .
tr	NP_PP_.	No funding on your part .
tr	OTHER	Didn 't she realize that this was Tampa ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Kowalski carefully placed the broken handle on the table .
tr	S_VP_.	"To "" rule out a possibility "" was the most vague and lamest reason to put a child on a drug ."
tr	NP_VP_.	He wheeled and started to walk away .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not that Ryder was rude about it .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I felt the barrel of a gun pressing into my spine .
tr	VP_.	asked Eddie , motioning to Curtis .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he proceeded to describe the exciting revelation that more than one factor was involved : that the two factors had to work together synergistically .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he fighting the need to hurt Danika ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Herr 'D on looked at him sharply .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I need to know anything else ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As you know Willow is quite an artist .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When Dr Keiser walked in he was clearly distraught .
tr	NP_PP_.	One by one they climb up , and onto the ship .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really want to leave it for good ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	It 's then that I turn to Lila and my eyes fill with tears .
tr	S_VP_.	Hiking along the water 's edge was a lot easier than up to the pass , where they huffed and puffed in the warm desert air .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it seems we 're still chasing ghosts .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course I told him he was getting out of it no more than I was .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I had this horrible premonition that security was going to find out we were there at any moment and throw us out .
tr	OTHER	Simple , but beautiful , the white mingling with the fading green .
tr	NP_VP_.	It was one of the few places that took cash and didn 't ask for ID .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it against that other man who was speaking words of compassion while secretly flicking his tongue like a snake ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I just say that out loud ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	A tear trickles down his cheek and I know I 'm about to start bawling at any moment .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Next day the trumpets rang early in the camp .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a moment the two had risen and moved back out into the yard .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the Angel lightly placed his hand on his shoulder .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then Darrel came to her office .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What you said is something not possible .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then mercifully went black .
tr	S_VP_.	Being among her people was as close to a family as she 'd yet to find .
tr	NP_VP_.	He didn 't hesitate but slipped one inside and begin to work her steadily while he sucked .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He waved to us and I could tell he was smiling .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could Heather not know something like that .
tr	VP_.	Be honest , be truthful and be complete .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	For a second Savannah thought he might kiss her and her heart jumped into her throat .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He took my hand when we got out of the car and I froze , instinct kicking in .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Before he could answer another gun exploded some way down the river .
tr	VP_.	Genie in front with her spear at hand .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her gut had told her that from the beginning and her gut was all she had to rely on .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she came to the conclusion I 'd hoped for I nearly pumped my fist in the air and shouted .
tr	S_VP_.	Trimming a Christmas tree with an alien was a different experience .
tr	NP_PP_.	The last module of the station .
tr	VP_.	asked Joey , fearing where this was going .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I hit the wall with enough force I swore I heard plaster crack .
tr	VP_.	Let 's pretend the warrior was right and the gods took her .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That he had given her a chance to talk to him .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he slammed the door shut and ran back over to me .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you have to make everyone mad at me ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That she went to the garden and had come home to find them missing .
tr	OTHER	And if the police wouldn 't come she knew she could count on the president of the neighborhood association to fly to her rescue .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he staring at the same subterfuge here ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The invaders attacked in the middle of the day through the small passages that gave the main cavern light and air .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe this was why Kellan didn 't want her help bringing him back to the Order .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he slowly withdrew , eliciting a whimper from her .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever he might have said went unspoken when he heard the approach of another boat .
tr	VP_.	Kill the man she actually wanted ?
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing the reality of the beast before his eyes was a shock .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even for a dream , this was getting bloody , and honestly , this wasn 't what she wanted in her subconscious .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What sickly hollowness had left Paul had been redistributed to William .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he had to set the record straight .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was someone on the other side of the front door , listening for noises coming from inside ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	It was late and Haruki was weak .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He had no choice but to put on the clothes he had been wearing the day before .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night I busily worked away on my story , relaying my nightmares in fervent prose and capturing the jittery atmosphere as I approached the lighthouse .
tr	NP_VP_.	Terror struck me as I thought of the only person who brought fear to the hearts of most immortals .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Hugh really want more than friendship from her ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But his chance of grabbing it , spinning around , and getting off an accurate round before being filled with holes was slim at best .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Before I could react one of the guards was already looming over me .
tr	S_CC_S_.	An innate sense of self-preservation reared its head and she suspected that giving him her name would be dangerous .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Before I knew it the drumming of bullets filled the air and I stopped .
tr	NP_VP_.	Teague and Bowen drew their swords in a split second and stepped in front of Graeme to ward off attack .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was he being so cold and aloof all of a sudden ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Everything really was on him now .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He slowly lowered the Glock and clutched at the wound beneath his left clavicle with a painful wince .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would Madrigal think if she could see him now ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I dare cook breakfast ?
tr	OTHER	Wasn 't that exactly what she 'd told Miranda ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Galloway reined his horse in , his eyes wide and curious as he came up .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Technically I 'm never supposed to see you guys again .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it ran down in a diminishing series of popping sounds that reminded me of Norton 's stubborn chainsaw .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the current President embroiled in some kind of scandal involving a mistress .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his previous statement hit me .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For vengeance and redress of their loss the Noldor came .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly the banging at the door stops .
tr	NP_PP_.	No sign of Baldwin .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did that look mean ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he approached Matteo crouched .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Well where does that quarter of a day go before the leap year ?
tr	OTHER	Except his unease seemed to be rooted in something else , something more .
tr	S_VP_.	Just going to church was a dangerous business .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At times Dawn was so energetic that Matthew had to ask her to slow up and be quiet .
tr	OTHER	There was a babble of voices from the front of the jeep and then we started moving again .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Anything I could to make my Dartmouth app more competitive .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The same one he 'd been thinking about near obsessively ever since the first party he 'd thrown as owner of the Polar .
tr	OTHER	Except for a pair of hiking boots .
tr	S_VP_.	To continue would only see them back where they started in ten minutes .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From the corridor 's intersection some ran right and others darted left .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He also held a hand over the boy 's eyes .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where am I supposed to go ?
tr	VP_.	Thank goodness she was staying there that night .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His jaws locked and the pearly white teeth settled in a threatening grimace .
tr	NP_PP_.	One demon at a time .
tr	OTHER	I was with her last night but somehow I forgot that she worked this morning .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Somehow she resisted the urge to squirm in her chair as his brown eyes remained fixed on her .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the entrance to the story tree I bend down into the familiar tunnel and start to crawl into the den .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean it really wasn 't human or that , like the ship he was on , it was pretending to be alien ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the dreaded questions start .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where 's Nate gone ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Part of me wants to give up and just tell Ryland what I know .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe it should just stay that way .
tr	NP_PP_.	All in a day 's work .
tr	VP_.	Don 't tell me you like Twin Oaks .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	There she put her herbs , jerky , several more ropes she made , with everything from the store room .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All this time I could 've been watching football .
tr	VP_.	said Frank , knowing the answer .
tr	NP_VP_.	He glances back at the house as the side door flings open .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And even now I cannot for the life of me decide on words that are fitting for what I wish to say .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Softly he kissed her temple .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I see him I 'll know if he 's lying .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I was just tired of being chastised by people on the subject .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her touch seemed to deflate the lump and he found himself able to push words free again .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Luckily they had helicopters .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every moment I spent with him made me feel more alive .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The travelers had passed , and John tossed me the large bag of coin he lifted from one of the lords .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Reluctantly I followed this enchanting woman to the stated destination .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And later I forgot , just like you forgot about the key tag .
tr	VP_.	""" No "" this time ."
tr	VP_.	Get over your petty disagreements , or whatever you walked in here with , because this is it .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She was asking me if I was all right when I 'd just told her I 'd wanted to kill her ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She was about to knock when it opened .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How then do we know of them ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so she dove headlong into her task rather than address those feelings .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then we had guys suffering from the effects of Agent Orange .
tr	OTHER	At that point I just wanted to talk about what the possibilities were so that I knew what to prepare for .
tr	S_VP_.	Kidnapping her to help him understand the pup had seemed smart at the time .
tr	S_VP_.	To display her attributes before other men was not good at all .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The boys laughed and I glared at them .
tr	OTHER	If only you hadn 't chosen to lie to me ... then , perhaps .
tr	NP_VP_.	She was dazed and confused , so much so that she stumbled back to the wagon and collapsed .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For now it doesn 't matter how complicated things have become between us .
tr	NP_PP_.	Double the price on her head .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Despite the speed of the aircraft they remained on the ground .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I 'm standing between them .
tr	S_CC_S_.	There was a loud bang from upstairs and they both nearly jumped out of their skins .
tr	S_VP_.	Slipping off course now wouldn 't achieve anything .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All the time he was painfully aware of her presence .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she couldn 't read the papers very well .
tr	OTHER	About his interminable hours at the law office .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When evening came Dillon rode a horse to find the slaves homes .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Katie only hoped they made it fast and didn 't hurt anyone .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She didn 't trust me but what was new ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she even called Anna ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least that 's how I imagine the session going .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How the woman managed to feed whole fish to elephant seals and sea lions , perform intricate surgeries and maintain a manicure was beyond Jackie .
tr	NP_VP_.	he asked calmly , with a tight grip on his voice , on his face .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now it was happening all over again .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he stayed still and kept trying to focus his eyes .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he entered his mothers cave he saw she had now placed herself upon her throne .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I didn 't want to tell him I 'd forgotten about his party , even though I wasn 't entirely sure he 'd told me about it .
tr	OTHER	Or is it an entity with cruel intent ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Then taking it from her he held it up to her face .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she pulled herself out of bed , showered and changed into a pair of jeans , adding a sweater because it looked colder outside .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then her gaze reached his face .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was it so easy for them ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he liked just about everything about her .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was this like seeing your life running before you , before you died ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Whose fault is that ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because only in truth can one find real joy .
tr	OTHER	Buzzard started laughing , a maniacal laugh that made the walls reverberate .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Again he stopped for a sip of his beer before continuing .
tr	S_VP_.	Finding his son had really been a matter of chance .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he gestures with his chin to the thing Maury is holding .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Pushing the wet hair out of her face she stood back up but didn 't move away .
tr	NP_VP_.	She wiggled uncomfortably in the plush , leather seat of the limousine , glaring right back at him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course you belong here .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I smoothed my hands reverently over the polyester fabric of the skirt .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes the good guys won .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	You 're crazy about him and I have to tell you I think it 's great .
tr	VP_.	To get out of accepting responsibility for our parents ' deaths .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course I want to hear your story .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had she done ?
tr	VP_.	Stabbed a finger into his chest .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I saw it .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes they 're warnings of the impending future .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where was this , Maeve ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If everyone charged the guards they could easily overpower them .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They hauled ass getting her out the door .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did her gift only work when he was in animal form ?
tr	S_VP_.	Dealing with humans made me fidgety .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just didn 't care about anything anymore .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I don 't say anything .
tr	OTHER	Maybe she just wasn 't a gambler , she mused as she left another casino behind .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When no one was looking I opened the coffin lid an inch or two and slid the number inside .
tr	OTHER	But no luck , as usual .
tr	NP_VP_.	A hint of a smile curved his lips .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After a while he felt her relax .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I mean you 're just like Bubba , carrying a torch for someone you loved in high school .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I quickly reached for it again , the clamp let go again .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he choose her on purpose or was it just convenience ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Nails in his coffin .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps Gladys told her .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Gus said and his arms shot out to hold the stinky fellow farther away .
tr	S_VP_.	Simply looking at her gave Liz a glimpse of what heaven must be .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he saw Chaim begin to stir .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Something about Jennifer was deeply disturbing and it wasn 't just the intense power .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Anthony pulls me to him and we hunch to the floor .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was a girl supposed to do when even God didn 't play fair ?
tr	OTHER	About the only thing she could afford , and still have a few dollars left over for traveling home , was a small salad .
tr	S_CC_S_.	They are difficult to catch and hard to fight and he would always outdo all others after these fish .
tr	VP_.	Tell them I need to see them now .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Well this was different .
tr	NP_VP_.	I was there with you this time , Lara .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had I gotten myself into ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I finally got all the buttons and pushed his shirt off his shoulders .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she was careful around them .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" This for now ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she lay on the bed and cried and sobbed .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the background there is a rustling , making me think she 's covering up the receiver .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Chapter Five Of Conversation and Cultural Differences Lily and Jimmy were absolutely thrilled .
tr	NP_PP_.	The sight of her parents staring blindly , blood covering their faces .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I pointed to the bed .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even his mother had not said anything to him .
tr	NP_VP_.	This one I had yet to see angry .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell did they want , anyway ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Something wasn 't right and his extensive military experience warned him of it .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they make love and war ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if he didn 't know .
tr	NP_PP_.	The Sermon on the Mount .
tr	NP_VP_.	The man went on beating the air for a moment , and then appeared to wake up .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was Eline Kline having an affair ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Much better than the last one .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe coming back wouldn 't be so hard .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What excuse was there ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Shane and Michael probably involved her when he didn 't show up for school .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was I doing on a roof ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever it is makes Des grimace .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I really prepared to hurt someone ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was he using the brake ?
tr	VP_.	Forget her touch ; forget her smell .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he was satisfied he got up and left .
tr	NP_PP_.	All this for a boy that they didn 't fully understand .
tr	VP_.	Walk out that door right now and find something else .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it was under our father 's wing we went .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" One hell of a big beach ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Holding the original suited man down with his foot he turned to Tabitha and took her hands once more .
tr	S_VP_.	Told me I would never fly again .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because that 's what love is , what faith is .
tr	NP_VP_.	My suit was head-to-toe black , custom-made , only something a Westinghouse would wear .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What made it worse was that Sir Albion ran the same hundred kilometres with us , leading the way .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If only he could remain like this forever .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Cooper inhales and the next thing I know we fall to the bed and I 'm pinned under him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After all , when she 'd brought him home to meet her family no words of love or promises of forever had been spoken between them .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We still must hurry .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Ten minutes later he stopped in front of the terminal .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	""" Beautiful morning "" he said ."
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he didn 't expect was to see his brother quietly come up from behind .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he was afraid his injury had scared his daughter and wanted to check in with her again .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I heard nothing .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did her uncle already have her ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Within a month they were back on Santorini .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Half of the marble vanity was now stocked with everything I 'd ever need .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the distance the sounds of small bells can be heard as Pierre brings the sheep home .
tr	S_VP_.	Feeling like she had been pulled in two directions all day she too was worn-out .
tr	S_CC_S_.	My hand closed over the door handle and I yanked , opening the door .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When they eventually entered into battle their wrath would be merciless and swift .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How on earth was she going to survive that ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he could not help but quote chapter and verse , for that was his nature and the way he had been raised .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he caught himself checking her thumbs out and decided .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It only angered the beast .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he felt none of the fear and foreboding that accompanied his previous trip .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once that 's gone I start tugging at the grate itself until that becomes dislodged from its housing too .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Every bit of attention he gave me made me sad because it was fleeting and meaningless .
tr	NP_VP_.	He shook his head .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I could have sworn Brandon had just told me he 'd had sex with Stephanie Wetzel .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whether it was the best way to handle the situation didn 't matter .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Leaving you there isn 't much better than heaving you overboard .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But this sky looked fuzzy , the stars not glassy but gauzy silver burrs .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How have you changed ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she was running with me , suddenly aware of the danger .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she even think of leaving the country when her sister was so ill ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I wasn 't in a charitable mood to begin with and this just made it worse .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Clint nearly smiled at the memory .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What troubled her most about her imprisonment was the extent to which none of this made any sense at all .
tr	VP_.	Might as well release the wheel and raise your arms .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had she disappeared so quickly ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Ran smiled and couldn 't hide it though she honestly felt guilty inside .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He didn 't find it a tedious task teaching her things he 'd known for centuries .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When we turned off the main road and started the steep ascent of Queen 's Drive Mr Boots perked right up , fidgeting excitedly .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The kiss last night was simply fantasy , a chance to explore .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Only after she 'd disappeared from view did he get back into his car .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because I 'm not like you .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Kylie stood up and went to her closet .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he rolled down his window , letting in the warm summer breeze and the smell of cut grass .
tr	S_VP_.	Dumping that much fertilizer made no sense .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the lock clicked .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Elijah and Julia sit on the floor , leaning on the same side of the bed .
tr	OTHER	Yet he did not know and it tortured him .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Immediately he stopped moving and scanned the surrounding area .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Ryder heard a scream .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On second thought maybe it was kind of stupid coming here alone .
tr	NP_VP_.	She had struggled in his arms , begging him to spare the life of her child .
tr	NP_VP_.	Her voice took on a singsong quality as she mimicked Sutton 's .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now I have to move on to the next angel written on it .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that means the relic ´ s closer than I thought .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he leaned forward like he was letting me in on a secret .
tr	OTHER	Can 't you hear them ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What child of mine , or even Tex 's for that matter , would have a shot in hell with the information I 'd just learned ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	The frame cracked and several strings popped .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps we 'll see each other ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she forget ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I hold my breath as the car inches forward and climbs the track to the outside .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he can 't bear to come in here .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she had to admit that seventy miles an hour was eating up the distance even faster than Jonathan could fly .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By then it was too late .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What matters now is what you do .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because of our connection my senses were heightened with his and our magic circulated in unison .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	with that I turned around and opened the door .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	These occasions invariably provided moments when the love Hal gave openly to David seemed to be transferred to Karen in an unguarded look of intimate sharing .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It really is beautiful here .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she was learning more and more about thinking outside the box as she contemplated blending her life with Kyle 's .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She curiously studies the small fish flopping under her paw .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she wobbled on her feet and frowned .
tr	VP_.	Let his daughter feel the blame for her mother 's death to the point where she thought about taking her own life .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did Spook say that Marsh 's nickname was ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly a train thundered past .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he crossed his arms on his chest , moved his gaze from the vista and turned his attention to the man who was speaking to him .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The bar was on the opposite wall and there were tables along the side wall laden with buffet food .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whether it 's the right decision or the healthy decision for me remains to be seen .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Within a few minutes they are back at the camp .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once I had my shorts back on I started walking away from the house .
tr	VP_.	Sacrificing his own history for the opportunity to be a part of history .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Finally he answered her .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He had no choice now but to comply with the Medical Board 's request .
tr	VP_.	Go to the next person .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was I supposed to give up everything .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I can feel bile crawling up my throat and a horrible pain hit my chest at his words .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he was prepared for them and did not fall a second time , even when one sliced across his ribs .
tr	NP_VP_.	I switch trains a few times and walk up into the sunlight .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we brought you a rental car over .
tr	NP_VP_.	They would need to be invited into his presence .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What could Vaughn do that he hadn 't done already ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it wasn 't the number he 'd used before so her body relaxed again .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His eyes bored into mine and I fidgeted with my hands in my lap .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What it wasn 't telling her was how to get up the courage to do it .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now it was too late .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I already know where I can find food .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Almost instantly I had a reply .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	How my father would drink too much , and then they 'd scream at each other .
tr	S_VP_.	Being married to David was comfortable , like a bed she 'd slept in for years .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Until they started acting like parents .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When the final skit was finished the three of them responded to the applause by bowing once and then applauding the audience vigorously in return .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	A snowy owl silently descended with claws outstretched .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I really needed to get away from him .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	as I passed her , hoping she was an RG member and actually knew who Jonah was .
tr	NP_VP_.	It was Trenton , wondering if I 'd made it home yet .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just wanted to start over .
tr	NP_VP_.	Mom shouted , pointing at me .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	You have all the reports and expert information you need .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she was at the London Gateway Services , too .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I guess she thought I would knock her up after we got married and I would never be the wiser .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Had anyone ever asked me how to get forgiveness before ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The word , the thought , the idea , echoed through my mind , along with everything I 'd seen and heard this evening .
tr	NP_PP_.	Shooting throughout the room .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many damn memories , and most of them were darkened by the pain he had caused Mairi .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least he was in the homestretch .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once he was happy with the first ankle he did the same to the second .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even if Tom isn 't feeling well you can call him .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I even want to know ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because he said he loves me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it was me who grabbed her before she could reach her destination .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How many of these spectators are loyal to Enzo ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet it seemed impossible that anyone could have come by the information .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I tried to forget about that and I thought about all of the other things I had to do .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I can show them all how to read the way the beacons pulse now , just like I did Argus .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What no one knew was that this was going to be one of Lewis and Martin 's final pictures as a team .
tr	NP_PP_.	Very kind of all of you , indeed .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way she said it made me wonder if she was only making it partly for me so I would come .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it was really more like a status quo that lasted two weeks .
tr	OTHER	The look he gave Erik was a hundred times more terrifying than anything I 'd ever seen .
tr	NP_VP_.	I could use the extra rest .
tr	S_VP_.	Below them the front lines of the British infantry began to form into their large bristling squares to receive the charge .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she 'd seductively bite her lip and run a finger lightly along her low neckline , while continuing her throaty chuckle .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he didn 't say that he would be .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Twice I 'd almost kissed her , making both of us break promises to people we cared about .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she glanced at the dance floor .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he wanted wasn 't there .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because he 's good at it doesn 't mean he cares .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who drank their tea with butter and salt ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the vet entered the room .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Rhett have a thing for people watching him have sex ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she was burning out .
tr	S_VP_.	Do not ever let anyone make you feel invisible .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Closing his eyes , seeking clarity of vision , forehead to the dome 's face he breathed in ancient scents .
tr	NP_VP_.	He lifted the sleeve of a blouse and let the smooth feel of silk run through his fingers .
tr	NP_VP_.	I went back to the bedroom and grabbed my phone , found three missed calls from Jonah , and sent a message .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When I resisted he let go after he gave me a bear hug .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know about me and Alec ?
tr	NP_VP_.	That 's when I knew I was beyond hope .
tr	NP_VP_.	Work had been mentioned in only the most general way .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When Celine heard her utter those words she felt like pulling her into her arms and bawling .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he hangs up the phone on me .
tr	OTHER	Nor did they trust the people at the command center anymore .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she kissed Mab on the brow with her icy lips and left .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 're you thinking ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Whoever had left the letter had hand-delivered it .
tr	S_VP_.	said Jimmy hoping it would help .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just think you need to really sit down and find out how she is handling this .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know something ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I opened my bag and dug out a change of clothes and headed for the shower .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She was letting Sebastian , the Blackwell Manor , and Hayley all go .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though , unbeknownst to him , the captain had him followed , able to report back the exact location .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there 's nothing .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Because then she 'd cut him off financially ?
tr	VP_.	Go back to sleep .
tr	S_CC_S_.	By that time it was way past dusk and the stars were out and blinking like tiny fireflies in the heavens .
tr	OTHER	Sits on a bunch of charitable boards .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What is to be will be .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Dori actually climbed out of the tree and let Bilbo scramble up and stand on his back .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that rule stem from the same fear ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she even understand what his ex-wife wanted ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How to start over was the big hurdle .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once he heard the sound of a truck approaching from behind him and he slipped into a handy screen of bushes until it drove past .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	"And then the minister said the long anticipated words , "" I now pronounce you man and wife ."
tr	S_CC_S_.	The witness identified the license plate of the truck and it was confirmed as Smith 's .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On the ground in front of it was a white slip of paper .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The glass cut into its green hand and it shrank back , releasing one of my feet .
tr	S_VP_.	Sticking her tongue into the recent hole she had just created had stopped her next bite immediately .
tr	OTHER	Then he looked at me and I could see the betrayal there .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But their eyes couldn 't be hidden .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On the far side of the chamber a series of wide steps led up to a raised area where the altar would have been in a cathedral .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From there I could get my bearings and hopefully make my way back to Troy through the blockade .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a while they lay there , quiet and thoughtful , not needing any words at that moment , just resting after an emotional cleansing .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But they were still debating behind closed doors the best way to do so .
tr	VP_.	Take the walls for example .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As I tried to stand up a bull was running at me .
tr	OTHER	"Courtney Cole 90 With My Last Breath , Book Three "" He cannot remember you ."
tr	S_VP_.	"Being a leader isn 't all lollipops and gumdrops Caitlin , he 's doing a damn fine job and you have to accept ------- "" ."
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where am I to go ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she 's not dead .
tr	S_VP_.	Passing through the trunk had left no stain on the reflective surface .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I closed it gently behind me and let out the breath I was holding .
tr	S_VP_.	Talking to a real human being might make things easier .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was all touch screen and so user friendly it would make Apple jealous .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he was trapped .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	CHAPTER 50 They pass by without even looking in our direction , though not because of Jael 's cooperation .
tr	VP_.	""" Bomb , in a baby ?"
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did anyone not blink for that long ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At one and twenty he was two years her senior and in a terrible state to be a husband .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he expect ME to carry my luggage ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How the hell had this happened ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With a gentle thrust the picture drifted away from the wall .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And they hadn 't served their purpose yet .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was he standing here feeling as if he 'd just lost something vital instead ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Down with the government !
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who comes to a different country to visit a Renaissance fair ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because you want a little rebound sex with the ex doesn 't make you a slut .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had I done ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the next two days it was extremely difficult for Karen to hide her inner tension from David and act naturally with him .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All the while the soft rain seemed to have a voice of its own pattering and echoing in his head .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the living room stood Byron .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I saw my name , nothing but my name , like it was the light at the end of the tunnel .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes she was a sliver of memory -- of sitting in enormously high grass while she held a buttercup to my face .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know who she was ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"If they kept some for breeding ... "" I choked on the word , disgusted by its implications ."
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whenever you want to we will .
tr	NP_VP_.	"Damon gave her his best "" shut up or die "" glare ."
tr	OTHER	What if I pick the wrong man ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she had been younger and visualised her end it had alternated between heroic and peaceful .
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting on the train for hours had left our legs sore .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How have the Invictus grown in such numbers ?
tr	S_VP_.	Coming down from those kinds of sensations was difficult .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would I say to her ?
tr	S_VP_.	Having several different families together under one roof for an unknown period of time could be problematic if morale sunk too low .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They never mentioned anything about six weeks of comp .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time I let my gaze drift over his shoulders to the others in the room .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just promise me you won 't fall too hard , or too fast for Royce until you know for sure he 's the one .
tr	S_VP_.	Keeping her alive would draw Max to him .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What Sandor doesn 't know won 't hurt him .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	About that day he kissed me .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even though careless was the last thing she felt at the moment .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As it was covered by shadow it turned red , a deep and ominous red , like old blood .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I stood there and listened discreetly .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he couldn 't leave his victims in the house .
tr	VP_.	Stranded as she 'd been .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I repeated myself .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did you not sense it through your blood bond ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he told his brother everything .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today I was reading slowly , enjoying the words as they rolled off the page .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you join the CSA you follow my orders precisely .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Later that morning she walked into the Community Centre with a cheerful wave to Tina who was cooking lunch for fifty pensioners in the enormous kitchen .
tr	NP_PP_.	No point in talking until she explained her presence .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She never sank in really deeply , of course .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	With a dashboard like a spaceship 's .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At first I can 't hear anything except the beating of my own heart .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Jules ' house was empty but her dad told me he left a key at the neighbor 's house .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now that little corner of her brain was insisting on being reasonable , as well .
tr	S_VP_.	Running Deer hasn 't learned to trust Daniel yet , and stands his ground .
tr	S_VP_.	Getting dressed might help .
tr	S_VP_.	Turning off the phone would take the rest of the power .
tr	VP_.	See if you can get that forklift going .
tr	NP_VP_.	Kropp looked at him intently .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Things she 'd never do for Ivy , not at this home .
tr	VP_.	replied the other two men together , before the three of them climbed the majestic staircase .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He gripped her hand and they sped over to the bedroom door .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he faced the people .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The red color drained from her form and she sighed like the weight of the world was rolling off of her shoulders .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I notice that he brought a prisoner with him .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that wasn 't the strangest thing .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Turning toward the door he looked back over his shoulder .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night Dillon laid awake thinking .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had he ever managed without her ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	"No , I can see that "" and giving the proper instructions to his slaves we got on our way to the forum ."
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she ready to face her dying aunt ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	About that time Aspen , Pris and Jaden pulled in the parking lot to pick me up .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Cole slowly let the edge of the curtain fall , closing off his view .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I didn 't want to leave the school with the one friendly face I 'd ever known .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	"Finally he said , "" Want to take Snowball to my place ?"
tr	S_CC_S_.	Dad and Mr. Ludlow had one hell of a fight a few months back and they just about called the cops in .
tr	NP_VP_.	She looked right at me .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why won 't you give me a fair chance ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 22 One afternoon he received an email from Karen Thompson .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now there was Sophia .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Finally they emerged on a broad landing and entered a small darkened room .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Ramon only nodded , his heart heavy as lead .
tr	NP_PP_.	Not nearly as pleasant as sharing your bed .
tr	NP_PP_.	Thanks for checking in on me though .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had she taken offense ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Later that evening her face began to swell .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell should he do ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	From the way Camila was sneaking looks his way he figured she knew something was up , but wasn 't sure what it was .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Ten minutes later she stood , panting , in front of a house as Will caught up to her .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He always flashes a twisted smile and acts as if my eyes are further down than physically possible .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he took a seat at the Lobby Bar his phone vibrated .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I was only three or thereabouts .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	~ My heart is in complete contradiction of itself .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least she thought he was .
tr	S_VP_.	Avoiding her oatmeal topped with sliced banana breakfast and substituting it with a chocolate jolt meant she 'd crave sweets for the rest of the day .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Sensing that this would be the last time they were offered such a reprieve .
tr	NP_VP_.	She put a hand on my shoulder .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it is over .
tr	NP_VP_.	Butch whined and popped his head out of my handbag .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Yeah , well I will make sure Sean won 't EVER take Nicole with him to the cove .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What happened to him ?
tr	VP_.	Explore his body and let those wonderful rough hands glide over hers .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On the train she had read a book on Parma .
tr	NP_VP_.	11 The baby stopped crying .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Again he reached for her hand , noting the redness of her skin .
tr	OTHER	Not on the porch .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And you should see Nick with Rena .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was going on ?
tr	NP_VP_.	A branch snapped about ten yards behind me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today she 'd find out how well it worked without a team .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever they are paying you to work here is not worth it .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Annika Granger had once been his pride and joy , the kind of soldier he should have been proud of .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That Monday I got a call from the HR Director from Bernstein .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The room suddenly dropped ten degrees .
tr	NP_VP_.	Sean looked so vulnerable that my heart ached .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I 've certainly grown more and more attached to the characters with every book I write about them .
tr	OTHER	"But ... "" I blew out a sigh ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Missed her so much the loneliness gnawed at his gut .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was my generation constantly documenting their lives for the world to see ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I had pushed open the door , and stumbled out into the cool night .
tr	NP_VP_.	The EOD was gone .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we sat and watched Jenny .
tr	VP_.	Get her on meds or something .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet she 'd seen that flash of longing in his eyes .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In fact she was quickly starting to think that she might even be cleverer than most the boys in her classes .
tr	OTHER	And how he 's doing .
tr	VP_.	Wander over the horizon for no reason but to see what is there .
tr	NP_PP_.	The bridegroom of every woman 's fantasy .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The mention of dragons reminded me of something he 'd said when we met Mr. Tiny .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I use it in my personal talks with potential clients and it 's very effective .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now here I have to admit at least a little sympathy .
tr	S_VP_.	Breathing in the aromatic wonder emanating from the curve of her shoulder .
tr	NP_VP_.	I wondered how she was doing .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If they find a way to kill us it will disrupt the entire universe .
tr	S_CC_S_.	This would be my first time to use ' the hole ' and I wasn 't looking forward to it .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there is something else too .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The first two times I went to bed as usual .
tr	VP_.	said Reid after a while .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it would seem .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know something he wasn 't saying ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he remembered the lack of condoms in his wallet and cursed under his breath .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he slams the mallet down on the knife 's handle .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every time he sweeps his tongue over mine , my insides flutter .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And my mom would always be in mine .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By Men they were almost forgotten .
tr	S_VP_.	Being honest with each other is the first step in a successful relationship .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Meaning they were some of the ugliest things I 'd ever seen .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And this miracle is what mattered to me now .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I went to the backpack fastened to my motorcycle and pulled out the small gift I had wrapped for her .
tr	OTHER	Just to have a simple drink in a hotel bar and go for a long walk after dark required subterfuge .
tr	S_VP_.	Searching for familiar faces .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they 've arrived .
tr	VP_.	Laced with anger , real anger .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why try to kill me and then act to save me ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Enough to destroy the drive and any information stored on there .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because I do require rescue .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Except he had taken the little runabout up to the base and that had a different set of keys altogether .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As much as she might like to .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	To find all the things I didn 't have the last time .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did he need to explain ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet it was so enthralling .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What do you do when a family member is having problems with another ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He ran screaming towards the creature , his abrupt attack and the noise he made surprising the enemy .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The things you can do ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she 's still not a lover .
tr	OTHER	Just give me her .
tr	NP_PP_.	Out of his life .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What neither of you seem to understand is that society cannot function without both of these halves .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I 'm glad of it .
tr	NP_VP_.	The two travelers looked up onto the path by which they would travel out of the valley .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When she peered out into the darkness at the street below she saw no sign of anyone .
tr	S_CC_S_.	My heart started racing and it felt like it was going to jump out of my chest .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he is released he can find peace .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can words even begin to describe ... so moving .
tr	VP_.	Find someone to go through the gates .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course I 've never met anybody with only one eye .
tr	S_VP_.	To let me know that he 's no more ready to let go of me than I am to be released .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Yet he felt little kinship with them at the moment .
tr	S_VP_.	Putting down Matthew was the last straw for Becky .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Dan ' r never did .
tr	VP_.	To find out exactly what has happened here and why ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though Katherine tried she hadn 't penetrated Grace 's shyness .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did he manage to break her filter ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Unless they recognize magic .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That she was leaving soon helped ease his mind about getting involved with a woman who had always affected him so strongly .
tr	NP_PP_.	Fear of being young , and having nowhere to go , and no-one to turn to .
tr	VP_.	Kissed her hard and deep and wild .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he thought about Watergate , and All The President 's Men .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it was easier than discussing why I did not watch much news .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the first time she wasn 't being heedless .
tr	OTHER	When she conceived a second time , he 'd dared to hope again that she cared for him , wanted to build a life with him .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there was only Iona ... in the circle with her wolves .
tr	NP_PP_.	One of my good friends ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the clouds were gone .
tr	VP_.	Show me you have actual emotions beyond regret that you got caught .
tr	NP_PP_.	The murder of my music teacher .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I have found out is that the soldiers may not have realised what they were taking .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now it was their turn to experiment .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What had been done to him would be repeated unless Essex recanted his vow to never help , an outcome he knew himself unwilling to accept .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 4 They were everywhere .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so my fruits grew upon my branches and hung there , never falling .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was pulling this guy 's strings ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How many people had ridden in carriages on the path that I now walked ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I said nothing at all .
tr	OTHER	So what if they were a touch too big .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She smiled at him and that was enough for him to lean over and kiss her .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If I thought you were I 'd break your teeth out with a hammer .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now she was reaping the bitterness that had been sown with a mistake ... an honest mistake .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I really want to do that ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was a sweet little place for families to come to enjoy life on a working Vermont farm .
tr	VP_.	said the Princess , more sharply .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though it might look more like a small message but he must have spent time on it .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just would never do that to you .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he have anticipated their move before they ever made it ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He just saw a hand throwing something in the wastebasket while exiting .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If they had fled , their odds that didn 't seem good neither , but at least it left some hope .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	During the 4th century BCE naturalism offered an analysis of the workings of the universe based upon certain cosmic principles .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was going on ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he just say that ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the lie began .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did I do ?
tr	VP_.	See how easy denial can be ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are you alive ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who gave you the right to sit in judgment on the male of the species ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Up from the ground Jacqueline rose .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she not , when she nursed me for ten years , was like a mother to me ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they even make it into the tunnels or were they stopped before they even got there ?
tr	OTHER	""" Zack ... "" "" Shh ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	That and if she wasn 't in danger she didn 't want to wake him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I remembered that The Right Man had told me the night we met that I had the coldest eyes he 'd ever seen .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But somehow he was comforted .
tr	S_VP_.	Had to say , running into that citizen prisoner had been a stroke of fortune for me .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	They could cure illnesses in the Middle Ages we could only hope to fight against today .
tr	OTHER	Do you really think more of my kin aren 't out looking for you ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For when you are at war , despite the horrors it does make you value every second that you breathe .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After about forty-five seconds of the flood the fire hoses were shut off .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then Steve led the Detectives some feet away where a small , dirt trail provided a pathway for hiking .
tr	NP_VP_.	I shouldn 't have said anything to him .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she wouldn 't .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They probably wouldn 't unless he tried to ride away .
tr	OTHER	What 's been done to me !
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just moved here from New York and don 't really know anyone except for people at the hospital .
tr	OTHER	Please try to be happy -- make Daddy happy .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By now people were going into different lines to avoid my strip tease .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She was intent on arranging the flowers just so and she had an expression of deep concentration on her face .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All this time I 'd been falling .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	While the adults stayed inside and talked about grown up things even hitting on the subject of the Black girls that had disappeared last month .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the others began to drift in .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Far too much time had passed for anyone to weather such solitude and remain sane .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The next morning I dithered before finally putting on the purple dress at the last minute .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But we did pretty well , overall .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And we 're in a church , for God 's sake !
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	My mom just stared in wide-eyed shock in the halo of my headlights .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I have taken on this job .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It only took four people per sofa to carry them down the hall , past the closed doors of the other classrooms , and into our room .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he trapped me inside this box .
tr	NP_VP_.	He touched the strap of my black string bikini .
tr	NP_PP_.	All because of one tiny pill .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Each night he and Randall enjoyed a brandy in the study before joining Mary Ellen in the dining room for the evening meal .
tr	OTHER	He 'll call my parents , we 'll take him out for a burger , and then we won 't hear from him again for months .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She just went back to talking about a table set we had seen and the style of the carvings on the legs .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The coil of tension in my belly tightened and I whimpered .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I turned to walk away but he held me in place and brought his face to mine .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he graduated .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With that she jumped up and hit her head on one of the taps letting out a cry of pain .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Pablo tell my mother and did my mother tell someone ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I could just get over these feelings that I had for him then I would be OK .
tr	OTHER	David introduces us as the elevator bell dings and Steve comes in , carrying David 's suitcase and my luggage as if they weigh nothing .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When Dallas arrived in Israel Jael was waiting at the airport to pick him up and off to the hotel they went .
tr	VP_.	Suck you off again .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could they possibly have known to look for him here , of all places ?
tr	OTHER	But somewhere inside myself I conceded ( but only to myself ) that maybe Emma had a point .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Rat soon had a fire going and was happily cooking .
tr	OTHER	Not knitting , crocheting .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now so that will also be my last words .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How would all of the old Gene get channeled into the new ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had he ever done in his life to deserve such a magnificent creature ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	There is a gash above his left eye and his lip is swelling rapidly .
tr	NP_PP_.	This mess with the actress .
tr	NP_PP_.	Six on the other .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Another thing I can teach you .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much depended on what happened when she came home .
tr	S_VP_.	Dealing with reborn vampires is always tough .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he didn 't have any illusions .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though she carried a stake she knew she would require more weapons .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	You just made your first sex joke .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And hopefully she 'd also get over having her heart broken by Jason Corwin .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Wanting to see those swords snap like the toothpicks he considered them he raised his arm summoning a shadow in a flash of power .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she even have a choice ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I peer over the edge of the boat .
tr	OTHER	As if the dead person cares then ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	They walked the block and a half to the Willard hotel chatting about the clients they 'd dealt with during the week .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then worry woke me up .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you convince him , too ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	"Isaac shook his head , "" Naw , today I 'm just the delivery service ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The rumors stuck to me like gum on the bottom of my shoe , clinging to everywhere I stepped .
tr	NP_PP_.	Because of the disk .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She slid her hand into her pocket and pulled out the note she 'd written before her shower .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What you saw in that office was bizarre .
tr	VP_.	Pull the damn trigger .
tr	NP_PP_.	The head of Severance Pay , Ltd. .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She sniffs and I think she 's crying .
tr	VP_.	' Not so much .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I 'd only been me for months .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then a breeze blew , as if from the ocean , fresh , salty , and clarifying .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she rose and walked around the table , brought her hand to his face , and kissed him .
tr	NP_PP_.	The crest of Evernight .
tr	S_VP_.	Being a wolf gave him a libido that meant it didn 't take him long to restart .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I got my trusty hammer and screwdriver .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It just wasn 't fair !
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did you both hesitate when I asked you to come with me to New York ?
tr	NP_VP_.	They are alive , the Hard Ones .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He ´ s so excited he looks like he wants to kiss the alien .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As I looked at the watch I knew that time was running out .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If Timms had been an experienced collector he would have thoroughly examined the doll before agreeing to the price .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Something rose up within him and he was determined to not let the mule get away .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he keeping her on reserve for if he became bored enough to settle down in another thousand years ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Each time she had stayed longer but left as soon as the questions turned personal .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell was he thinking ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time she made a frightened grunt .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I 'm going to research the Scottish folklore now I am here .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Your brother just called me and asked if I could meet him in Vegas for the weekend .
tr	OTHER	So that I could become a beach bum .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Pushing past him forcefully Richard growls .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And still I sat in my chair , hoping and waiting for him to turn to me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She even turned off the ventilation system .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he let out a ragged exhalation .
tr	NP_PP_.	The opposite of the vamps ' eyes .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the background the robot was still abusing the Minotaur .
tr	VP_.	spurring to a canter .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I wish with all my heart the drops would just wash it away .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The water formed rapids as it forced its way between the massive stones and the sound it generated concealed any subtle noises made in the vicinity .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She 'd hired him to stop the assassination attempt , telling him she could not trust the assignment to anyone in-house .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did he know she cared for Gail 's brother ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night Kevin proposed .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she 'd risk having her husband come home to one of those notes on the doorstep .
tr	OTHER	After the preliminary prayers came this evening 's petitions .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I won 't serve any time in jail because everyone 'll confirm what a bastard you are and how you bullied us .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he 'd be sure to get a pistol for himself .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How late would I have gotten my body back if Tom Culpeper hadn 't shot me ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Andrew I felt as if I was actually there , it 's so strange but I dreamt of it in detail .
tr	NP_VP_.	He wanted Jess beside him , close to his heart .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But surely no one 's fooled .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Unless it was because Cain walked in on them .
tr	VP_.	Must be nice up there .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They never let me talk to her when I called the house .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can I help you ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I 'm with you I feel like I can finally be myself .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it okay for Delilah to divulge all her secrets ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who should be there but Emily ?
tr	S_VP_.	Being visited by a weird supernatural force will do that to you .
tr	OTHER	Not sure he 's the one for me like he feels about me .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But low on the front door I saw a serial number , in black .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her father 's leg was well bandaged and he was seated on his horse with the help of a wedged blanket .
tr	VP_.	Remember why she was here .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would happen if she gave in ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now the rights to her parents ' , my clients ' house , are fully inherited by her .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She was out of his league and he knew it .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When he tried a few test grunts and roars they still sounded too high pitched .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once we get to the stairs we 'll all drop to one knee before the five Mystics of Angels .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she 'd driven to the next town and sat in the back row of the theater .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he went back to the rookery to get some much-needed sleep .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I read the letter again .
tr	VP_.	Roland and Karan , for being who they are .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who would have guessed that a nerd like me would keep a damsel in distress safe from the undead ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Until Jonah McAllister walked into the restaurant .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she couldn 't figure out was why .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he realize what he was asking ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she have let this happen ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I resisted the urge to tell her to get out of my restaurant and fixed their food in silence .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What kind of game was the guy playing ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Our sex last night had benefited significantly already .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why is Evelyn here , in Marcus 's house ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I was becoming overwhelmed with the amount of compassion I was feeling for her .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He just sat back and enjoyed listening to Savannah .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe that was the real magic of love .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he didn 't even look back at Sean and Curtis .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Mostly I 'm wondering what the hell I 'm doing on the other side of the world .
tr	S_VP_.	Finding that Dahlia was very similar made him surprisingly happy and at peace , even in the midst of their situation .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What lay in the past of each individual was gone , and what they were now was what was important .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I personally know the contents of every scroll , map , and volume relevant to your inquiry .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that 's why you don 't consider you guys serious .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And you and Will can both self-destruct from your bad behavior .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What they needed was objective information about the people who had built the city , and their life .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he lives off the bounty he makes , not his salary .
tr	NP_PP_.	Time for the axe .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the gun 's helter-skelter lights showed her the way .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It stopped and Angelina and Sam got out , handing the sunglasses back to the officer in the front seat .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That way you will have at least done what Amelie is asking and she will be pleased by that .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did they insist on getting their faces in the announcements too ?
tr	VP_.	Save it from what ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I pushed my sick heartache aside and smirked back at him .
tr	NP_PP_.	No way in hell !
tr	VP_.	Let her go on thinking that .
tr	S_CC_S_.	A few days had passed since that fateful night and no one had heard from the boys .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe that 's why it didn 't feel right .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Along the corridor there were signs of people stirring as the breakfast hour approached .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Her dress was charred , her pale skin coated with dust , but stranger still she was smiling .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet she 'd stuck it out for years .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How are you , my fuzzy darlings ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it began to fold upon itself .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he 's afraid of what this man would do to him for not obeying an order .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it wasn 't his fault .
tr	S_VP_.	Lying out there in the Alaskan snow hadn 't been cold .
tr	S_VP_.	Looking up I could see the van creeping into life .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Each time he walked away .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the last soldier had sprinted around the corner of the building he strode to the door and knocked .
tr	OTHER	A dog at his side and a wound in his heart .
tr	NP_VP_.	He wasn 't sure what to do .
tr	NP_VP_.	He ran for hours , while Pat rode at a gallop .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As we approached the flat Dee interlocked my arm .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean Jackson was choosy or was Dan just seeing things through rose-colored glasses ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we 're fine .
tr	S_VP_.	Saying it out loud just made the pain worse .
tr	VP_.	Chew it off with her teeth ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she will call again .
tr	NP_PP_.	Phillip to the rescue .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Whoever had thrown it had thrown very hard .
tr	NP_PP_.	Said Lea while looking at the floor .
tr	OTHER	Can you feel this here ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When Calvin remembered his friends he laughed again seeing them huddled together .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Within a few minutes she was back on firm ground .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many things weren 't right about this .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That way we wouldn 't have to worry about Nolan being there .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before she could spend much time trying to get herself under control she saw light over the base .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'm sitting up in bed to write this , with a candle lighted by my bedside .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I was supposed to write a page about what I 'd just read .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the next hour she tried to collect her thoughts as she took a long swim .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Some hero he was turning out to be .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I finally finished and you were gone .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Nicolas walked her to one of the waiting cars Lily had provided for them .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And somehow I 'm certain that until I do know , until I understand , things will never be the same for me again .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I had everybody 's attention .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I started to run down the street with so much adrenaline lashing through me it felt like my chest was going to explode .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there 's still three more , so that 's only a start .
tr	OTHER	A place for everything , and everything in its place .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment I feel whole .
tr	S_VP_.	Hearing it in the middle of the night is not so heartwarming .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He carefully rested an index finger against the cold familiarity of the trigger and took up the slack .
tr	OTHER	A friend whose sister was about to have a baby .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Then why was it I who ended up feeling the pain of my brother 's blade ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I was already starting to get that bloated drunk look but I 'd given up caring .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was everyone ready to see her in a covered wagon , forging ahead to some primitive new land ... at the bottom of the world ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Moments later she walked back out .
tr	OTHER	Not in this body .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did this man become a top executive ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now you 've got six that he intended to retire himself - one of which managed to get him first .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was it when he touched her she felt her insides go soft and gooey ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	She whimpered , trying to wiggle away from Garrett 's unwavering tongue but he gripped her hips with his hands and kept her in place .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the vamps used technology to supplement their already enhanced vision .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He never attempted any tricks he couldn 't do perfectly .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	There it was again .
tr	OTHER	Or was she a moron for even thinking like that ?
tr	OTHER	""" Join Claude and the horses ."
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Janet just stared at Roth .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was Kenny kicking me to the curb , all because I had stopped to help the girl ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Brian pointed to a dark rounded stone elevated from the damp ground .
tr	S_VP_.	Staring up at her was Sam , with two mugs of coffee and already dressed in new , dark jeans and a navy wool sweater .
tr	S_VP_.	Hoping for something is not the same as expecting it .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it was dark and black and wasn 't human .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Some things simply demand to be observed in respectful silence .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I glanced at Wesley he grinned , showing me moon eyes and a mouth full of glowing teeth .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I want to be dead and buried down below in the village graveyard ?
tr	OTHER	Isn 't that how it always works ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she kissed him back like it was true .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did you say his name was ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Technically I hadn 't broken any written laws because we didn 't have any , but I 'd broken the unspoken canon of neutrality .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps even hair dye .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We all looked around .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are you here ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If you were I was going to beg in his favor .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They eventually used old vinyl records as Frisbees to kill the zombies .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least Cole Trickle was .
tr	VP_.	Waited for her to turn and glimpse my dark form in the woods .
tr	NP_VP_.	Sexual norms are abandoned .
tr	OTHER	Besides , wouldn 't their inner , magical spirit help them out where necessary ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only Helmsley bore a knowing smile upon his face , for he had heard her speak of Buchan many times before .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He still loved me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They all watched as the two men in suits walked through the door to the brilliant outside .
tr	S_VP_.	Focusing on destruction was costing the military time , money and lives .
tr	NP_VP_.	I did it to get you back !
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But more than anything else she was tired and annoyed at no longer being in control .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps he smelled something .
tr	S_VP_.	Waiting in the heat with her was not a happy prospect .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Normally she heard animals moving in the forest as well as birdsong .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course these were prodded by the questioner .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How I responded to rejection was entirely up to me .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What else explained how I 'd drawn that beer bottle to me without touching it ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	* Maggie couldn 't wait to get started .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At that moment Sylvie walked into the room .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he 'd take it .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was bleeding , crying out in pain .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The whole time I was wondering what I would wear .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I really hoped I could keep them all safe .
tr	OTHER	The darkness around the edges of his eyes .
tr	S_VP_.	Looking down she discovered she was floating , above the ground .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He had hoped against hope they 'd use it , writing and rewriting it to ensure it had a certain poetic something .
tr	OTHER	Her hair is still its original honey blond , her skin has minimal wrinkles , and her boobs don 't sag .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It sounded a lot better than being the reincarnation of someone I didn 't really know .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I was stuck .
tr	S_VP_.	To have his daughter become a vigilante , stooping to the level of the enemy ?
tr	OTHER	Was there anything else on her desk ?
tr	NP_VP_.	It 'd be the most annoying thing , except for the fact that I have thousands of other problems .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she had no choice .
tr	NP_PP_.	Care for some company ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Against her shoulder Tabitha felt Grace slowly lift her head .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	* * * * * Joey stood up first .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I still care for the big lug ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When we got to the hospital my parents and Aunt Molly and Uncle Paul were already there .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Tolliver really want me to sit in my room while he had fun ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When the bribes didn 't work Capone started sending his thugs in .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He stared at Seldon and it didn 't take him long to decide .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could Alec do this to her ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she did remember about Dom was that she hadn 't liked him .
tr	NP_VP_.	I grumbled , turned around , and grabbed the tray from where I 'd set it down on the floor .
tr	S_VP_.	Setting him up with Ashleigh had been a bad idea .
tr	OTHER	And with those words we were off .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet she wanted more power than she 'd had before .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he thinking hanging those things on the smooth white walls of the Malibu house ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she supposed to be grateful that he allowed her to live ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	"Make an appointment with my assistant and she 'll make sure I 'm there , "" he said dismissively ."
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A day I wouldn 't soon forget .
tr	VP_.	Do not snap it !
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I tell you how pretty you look in your bridesmaid dress ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	They 'd all been supportive and encouraging at the time she 'd needed it most .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In one blurry moment she was in his arms .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it occurred to her that her grandmother hadn 't asked this out of idle curiosity .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I leaned against the tree , trying to catch my breath .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That she wanted to help him in this mission told Kelly she was in trouble .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you hear how she told you your dreams would become real ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Light through the thin white curtains .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For all the people above I am grateful and humbled by their support , love , and friendship .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Mommy where are you going ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Ever since he 'd made the mistake of kissing her yesterday afternoon on deck he 'd been spiralling out of control .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Mostly I chose to leave because of the vision of my mother .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I make the right choice ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Except I 'm wearing Dauntless black , boots and pants and shirt and jacket .
tr	S_VP_.	Didn 't seem to care he was in his altogether for the world to see .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now news that Royalist armies were on the march and seemingly on their way to Dorset stirred the Council to action .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she think that had been a fluke ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	She kissed him and his moaning growl set her body on fire .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because there is only one Alyssa Frank .
tr	NP_VP_.	The word exploded from Ransom 's lips as he returned the glare .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then John started to think and imagine his own stuff .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it was that creepy kind of staring , too , that made a person 's skin prickle .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	One of your girlfriends just broke up with her boyfriend so you were spending more time giving her emotional support .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was she taunting me so deeply ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I vote that we sink ALL their ships , burns their boats , and kill any pirate that stands against us .
tr	NP_VP_.	She hadn 't pulled away .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was I thinking ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I ask for birth ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We just stared at it for a while , Pepper and Hawkins sniffing around the mounds of dirt .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What most people who don 't live in a forest village don 't know is that vines are actually very stiff .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I should have expected .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Early the next morning she would begin the trek home to her grove .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was the point of living like this anymore ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she 'd learned about him had come out in bits and pieces .
tr	VP_.	' Are you any good in a fight ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Taking a small moment to enjoy the peace and splendor she brought to his hectic world .
tr	OTHER	A harbinger of things to come .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why do you and Jayden pretend you 're still together ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he saw everything he 'd hoped for going down in ruins because of Cassidy 's foolish actions .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he treat this strange woman better than he had my poor abused mother ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The GM frowned almost imperceptibly .
tr	S_VP_.	Knowing she would not sleep until he answered some of the many questions swirling rapidly through her mind .
tr	OTHER	Do you know he had plans in place to put up barriers vampires couldn 't cross without permission ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The things I felt , my fears , my pain , and what I wanted most in my life .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only I 'm not alone .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"If it wasn 't for ... "" Beth spoke over him , then he over her ."
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time his howl sounded like he was in pain as bullets exited his back and struck a nearby wall .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least David 's parents are unaware of all this .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I can 't make any promises to you , Ellie , because more than likely I 'd end up breaking them .
tr	S_VP_.	Had our Indian saved us again ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she saw her attacker .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she want to ?
tr	VP_.	Mrs Barns ' tears up .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Therefore that type of attack rarely happened .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The only family she 'd had .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Lives that would be far better than anything she had experienced .
tr	S_VP_.	' Do not be afraid , ' said Altair , closing his eyes .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now Bill can attest to this .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he turned around all that he could see there appeared to be a magnificent mountain , with a larger mountain overshadowing it .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where was the grief ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Any chance you could drop by the set first thing tomorrow morning ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With any luck they would achieve total surprise .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many things she had taken for granted that were forever lost to her .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because Jax has always had problems , has always been stubborn as hell .
tr	NP_PP_.	A way for the world to make sense -- and someone who understands it .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where was all this leading ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I decided to start at the beginning .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why don 't you tell Alexis about the time Travis cornered you in the barn ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	"In a way she wondered how she might feel seeing her "" twin "" face to face ."
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And once again I was overwhelmed by the size of him , the masculinity , the familiar smell .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Hope your sister knocks you out again .
tr	NP_PP_.	Fighting against a sword that can 't be beaten .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When he woke up the next morning to her shy suggestion that they should make love again ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	To insist that he was sure Peter meant to be faithful .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	During all that time Henrietta was my only nurse .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I felt warm breath graze my ear and I spun again .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If only I could be more like him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At some time they will either find a way to scan it or just wreck it out of frustration .
tr	VP_.	To ' put to rest ' ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then we 're going to stay ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	She got pregnant and he went back to her .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	~ The End ~ Prologue September 15 , 1996 HE sat next to me again today .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The sea air and the physical activity they had an appetite .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it was a huge tomb .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now he feels like yelling .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it 's not you .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you think about me ?
tr	VP_.	""" For all of us ."
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then a thought struck her .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe Damien knows what this is about .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What time shall I return for you ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she studied and tried to stay out of his way .
tr	S_VP_.	Just looking at it made her sleepy .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Indeed the rebels had never been stronger !
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What we try to foster here is an appreciation for life being difficult and unfair and not always what we sign up for .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Above all it is the ultimate aim of our mission to guide us .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The time he 'd missed their first anniversary weekend retreat that they 'd planned for weeks .
tr	NP_PP_.	One of the best .
tr	OTHER	In front of the car was a thick oak tree .
tr	S_VP_.	Leaving him here would be the ultimate sacrifice .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They always died within a week .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he have forgotten about her ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Still she neither saw nor heard Brad move .
tr	VP_.	Cast to opposite sides by society and its aesthetic judgements , set on opposing paths towards our destiny .
tr	VP_.	questioned Pao Peng , the secretary 's old Shanghai partner , suddenly becoming alert .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She really wasn 't .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As electronic signals beamed across the Pacific Ocean they triggered a flurry of beeps and buzzing convulsions .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would happen to her and Liam ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How were the others involved ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Put Strom on the line and tell him I need a five-minute piloting lesson .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that doesn 't mean it isn 't the truth .
tr	S_CC_S_.	This was usually Edward 's fault and sometimes Eadie would cry .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How much water would it take , he thought , to loosen all the moving parts that ached inside ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But we were there , James .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The first moment you placed your hands on mine .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And all she could see was a kid scared out of his mind .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When she saw her sister leave Prue ran for the bathroom and threw up .
tr	OTHER	No longer could she blame her father for hiding this particular part of the truth from her .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I told him about how I fried computers and cell phones and watches .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she remember anything else about the alternate realities ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he let him go .
tr	NP_VP_.	Someone had seen that Bill was handcuffed when he was led away .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he knew from study that the codices were all put together the same way and folded in a screen type manner .
tr	S_VP_.	Don 't believe anything anyone says .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then we both quit trying to pretend we weren 't blubbering and sobbed simultaneously .
tr	NP_PP_.	No sight or sound of vampires .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He glanced back over his shoulder and his eyes flashed red .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she see monsters ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After a few hundred more paces Jamison stopped and caught his breath in awe .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he have to sound disgusted ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where did that come from ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The end of Dominic 's freedom .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it was just relief at seeing him , no matter how much he annoyed me now .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	"And then she said , "" We both look a lot like Father , in the face ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a nook between two cottages something moved in the shadows .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What he liked best , what he craved ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every time he closed his eyes he heard wolf howls and saw his daughter with her bitten hand .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I could not complain .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She finally looked at me again .
tr	OTHER	The one who needs to somehow make things right with her because I made everything so wrong .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can that be ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the sun hit the horizon and rays of light shot over the ground like laser beams and hit the swamp .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The man she 'd loved and lost before .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I don 't recall it .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Same with all the gold and precious stones you see everywhere around here .
tr	VP_.	Hiring a master chef to cook his favorite meals .
tr	VP_.	Don 't come here .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now I had no words .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is this man ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The rear end of her , that is .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't they have teen magazines in hospitals ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he regret what they had done ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The other diners looked over at us with amused smiles , making me feel very conspicuous .
tr	NP_VP_.	Celeste giggled like the younglings on the video box called a television .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the quiet of the first act Rena heard the door behind her open .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she did feel was alone and lacking .
tr	VP_.	Turning over rocks that might need to stay still .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she hurried from room to room , looking for pictures of Cheyenne .
tr	NP_VP_.	None of this should ever have happened .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She was wondering about the implications of the fact she was conversing with an angel .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then a thought hit her .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe that accounted for the missing Werewolves and Vampires .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I didn 't get a chance to lecture her now because she unexpectedly pulled me closer , tightening her hold and bringing our lips together .
tr	NP_PP_.	Enough of the warm fuzzies .
tr	S_VP_.	To kill again right now would be too soon .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From my left Lucious Cary rode up , a rare smile on his face .
tr	S_VP_.	Only getting the job done .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Yet she couldn 't hide the colors of her essence from the discerning man .
tr	NP_PP_.	The definition of ragtag .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As we reach the dance floor I recognize the music .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Judging him and convicting him of some crime he was unaware of .
tr	OTHER	And one with top-notch security .
tr	VP_.	Don 't speak to me .
tr	NP_PP_.	Blood pumps from the hole in his chest and onto his desk .
tr	NP_PP_.	Nobody on Rikers Island 48 .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Inside the mansion the storm filled the building with many eerie and bizarre sounds as it crashed down upon it .
tr	OTHER	His hands not his own for this instant , Ganondorf blinks across the small platform faster than any in attendance could perceive .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How different would the timeline be for people who grew up with that religion or whose entire families had been of that religion for generations ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the officer was gone it was deathly quiet .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would someone who lived in a place like this want with her , she wondered nervously chewing her bottom lip ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She suddenly dragged him into a fierce hug .
tr	NP_PP_.	A quick visit to New Orleans .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it hasn 't opened yet .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One day it 'll all come out .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he figures if he control the air going in , he control the sound going out .
tr	S_CC_S_.	My stomach turned and my heart raced .
tr	S_VP_.	thinking her mother must still be mired in her nightmares .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His nerves were shattered and he expected some big meaty police hand to grab him at any minute .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the back of my consciousness I hear a struggle .
tr	S_VP_.	Sleeping with Juliette would be the answer to a dream , his and obviously hers , too .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What can I say to him now that this is done ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	One bright point of light is still shining in the sky and I imagine it must be a planet .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Another confrontation he wanted to avoid .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I touched her hand and looked over her twice , except for a bruise on her cheek she seemed to be ok .
tr	NP_VP_.	He pointed to her couch .
tr	S_VP_.	To do so would have meant that he was more than physically involved with her , and that he refused to accept .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	If you ever crossed the line , it isn 't them you 'd need to worry about .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What made him so special ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she made a dismissive gesture .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I sorted through everyone I knew .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then my eyes stopped at a particular thing on the wall .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was more than being physically weary .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could it be possible ?
tr	S_VP_.	Knowing that someone was trying to kil me didn 't put me in a smiling mood .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe he 's the one sent her to make the hit on me .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she acted on instinct .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Mitch remained seated , ' You 'll need to know that I made a mistake with the coach company .
tr	NP_VP_.	she exclaimed , swinging her feet over the wall .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In his mind things appeared to had turned chaotic .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Why haven 't they told me anything yet ?
tr	S_VP_.	Touching her was soothing somehow .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I decide to make myself a smoothie while Mom frowns at her phone messages .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Any minute they would rouse and snarl the alarm .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That he 's developed a humane side .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the computer care if there were carpets on the floor ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it was being kept closed for a reason .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Caleb replied smoothly , seeming approachable like someone you 'd want to tell all your secrets to .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Evelyn emerges into the lobby , her posture regal , like a queen returning to her kingdom .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I 'd lost a lot of weight and my skin looked like shit .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How she wanted to make love to him .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or at least there had been .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why in the world have you not asked me to sing our song together ?
tr	S_VP_.	Hiding out in the open is always the best way .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At this all three of them laughed .
tr	OTHER	Much faster than she herself could hope to be .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I get up from the table and put my plate and teacup in the sink , like it was a normal evening .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I try taking a step away but his hand reaches for my h * ps and brings me back to him forcefully .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she almost shoot me with a freaking arrow ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I used the fancy electronics in Ethan 's car to dial Jeff 's number , hoping he 'd be sympathetic to our predicament .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What marked him as distinct was a burn mark branding his sloped forehead .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could seduction come so easily to some ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I almost punched a guy in the bar just last week for talking about those damned pictures my mom won 't take down .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In it are two coffins .
tr	OTHER	And where were the other Brothers ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Nadia had every reason to doubt and distrust what he told her now .
tr	NP_PP_.	A pit bull in gray satin .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every weekend we go for a walk in a different part of the city .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe Vane had prepaid her before he 'd decided to skip out to wherever he 'd gone for the week .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I spent lots of weekends hanging sheetrock , installing crown molding , and building pretty cool closets if I do say so myself .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why don 't you join us ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I see the door leading to the room where I saw Helen .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"If Sasha was to meet with an "" accident "" that took her life then he didn 't have to worry about it ."
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only Vinny and Leah had entered .
tr	OTHER	Was love blinding me ?
tr	NP_PP_.	All over but the crying .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she going to leave Shadow Falls and get mixed up in something terrible ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I discovered that my head was in his lap and we sat on a swing of sorts that had a canopy stretched overhead .
tr	S_VP_.	Having someone perform those duties for her again was going to take some getting used to .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now He could only visit occasionally in spiritual form .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could anyone destroy lives so unfairly ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that was what she 'd meant , though she wouldn 't come out and say it .
tr	OTHER	Do they look ... gross ?
tr	S_VP_.	Letting him know her was much too dangerous .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he gazed at my mother they glimmered like emeralds .
tr	NP_VP_.	There were a ton of people in the station , packing into trains going north and south .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had he expected ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who threw the stone at me ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She shouted as loud as she could .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Hagan 's eyes slowly opened .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he kissed him on the lips and rested his cheek on Jase 's chest .
tr	NP_PP_.	A convoy of werewolves .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he was so gentle when he took care of her .
tr	OTHER	A fact that still jabbed his pride .
tr	VP_.	said Sweet Gas indignantly .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	David went stiff , growing taller , his hands stopping short of the scrolls they were about to grab .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Letting go of the hawthorn staff with his left hand he watched as the raiders approached him more quickly .
tr	NP_VP_.	She signed his slip , made her own notation on her clipboard , and waited until Harry drove off before she smiled at Nathan .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By now she adored him and couldn 't go a day without him .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Not that I had any reason to believe Merrin would be threatened by me .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly Geary realized that the water was getting lighter .
tr	OTHER	If she only knew .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Seven times he will save your life .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And you don 't want her because she 's a princess ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I slowly and hesitantly was seated across from him .
tr	NP_PP_.	The extra key to his penthouse ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I shout , exasperated .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But at least he wasn 't as terribly charming and resolutely civilized as all the other entities she 'd met on the Favor .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course he does .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I drank them all straight from the bottle , not even bothering with the glass of ice she had sat on my tray table .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why can 't we share in what they have ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The pounding of his feet on the pavement , the blur of trees and sunshine and clouds .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't the wolves realize what was happening ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least that was my new hope .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The subdued exterior lights softly illuminated the area , providing the perfect backdrop for a romantic rendezvous .
tr	VP_.	Walking and walking and walking .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Since she was eight years old she had wanted nothing so desperately than to belong and be loved .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the ground beneath us started to shake .
tr	S_VP_.	To slay his own brother before his brother killed him .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"When the silence was growing uncomfortable Meg squeezed Jack 's arm and said : "" No , best that you go on your own today ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they walked into the darkness .
tr	S_VP_.	Keeping my mind going helped me to keep my feet going .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I will come for you .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I could do nothing but die .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really just tell his secret ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	"After a while he says , "" I didn 't know about you for a long time ."
tr	NP_VP_.	Jake matched its stern expression as he spied on the audience .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When are you here ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He then snapped his gaze to his left wrist and checked the time from a watch that wasn 't there .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In such cases the little boat and I were called into service .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Whatever she is about to tell me is what caused her such fear .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I feel the person shift in the seat and I cringe as their warm breath caresses my cheek .
tr	VP_.	Completely out of touch .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He dropped his hand and she walked away .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Only with Tethys Aran 's death would he truly be secure .
tr	VP_.	Showing other players that you 're boss of the goal area .
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting in the dimly lit family room with a cup of coffee was Stephanie 's newly found sanctuary of peace and quiet .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because I 'm having a bad day doesn 't mean you have to stay home and play babysitter .
tr	S_VP_.	Exactly how Burnett intended to make him pay wasn 't clear .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we should expect you back here within the hour .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he plan to throw himself out the window ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Once she even dared to sweep the tears away from his face .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The music was pounding through the speakers and people were dancing and chatting .
tr	NP_VP_.	It 's ages before anyone answers .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her face had been in shadow but her words were enough .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	In my sleepy state I tell myself I 'll do anything to keep him here with me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I barely noticed the discomfort of the wheels hitting the cobbled road as we swept over a bridge and through a wide opening in the stone fence .
tr	OTHER	Ready to shove the point into whatever part my hand landed on .
tr	NP_PP_.	A definite shake of her head .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What a fucking joke .
tr	S_CC_S_.	All the signs were blank and she felt the panic begin to rise up her throat .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Far off in the West the full moon was sinking , round and white .
tr	S_CC_S_.	My senses became even clearer and my magic became instantly stronger , rushing quickly throughout my body .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it hit me : look up Lauren 's website .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe they were bothering Missy .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he realized what it meant .
tr	NP_VP_.	He opened this one slowly , peeking into the room before committing .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the most frightened .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But you 're definitely beautiful enough .
tr	OTHER	A mother who was on her side .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He obviously didn 't care if it took her away from the things she cherished the most .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Yet here she was , undeniably emerging , the lush curves of her body on stunning display .
tr	NP_PP_.	Three times as many guns .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now it was Friday and time to see Sharon off .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before they reached the car Johnny stepped out .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although still completely distracting .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Taking a calming breath he moved to one of the boxes stacked alongside the wall and tore open the lid .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they walked a little way out of the village until they came to a small meadow beside a stream .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It never brings me relief .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Above them someone began to speak and address the crowd .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon everyone would know .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When midday came he got ready for another journey down into the Mountain .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Over his head there hung from a hairy tube-like branch a great spherical object , almost transparent , and shining .
tr	OTHER	2 The freeway was crowded .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was her perpetual anxiety over her impending trip causing hallucinations now ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Almost immediately there was a knock on her door .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He 'd obviously left the kitchen and she realized he 'd walked toward the couch that blocked her hiding spot .
tr	NP_VP_.	I was another roadblock now , another obstacle in the way of Avalon 's perfect dream for our society .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	To the bottom of the ravine you went .
tr	OTHER	I long for grass that isn 't mowed down to an inch high , and wildlife beyond a few birds and a stray fox .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did it have to be him ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Cats under your feet .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometime during the night Karla and Gabrielle had slumped from his shoulders and were now using his thighs for pillows .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And please don 't get all righteous on me now .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last thing I remember we were on the Lost City floating in space somewhere .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	All that time she 'd been dragging him she 'd half expected to turn back and find a corpse .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I realized .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she loved you with every bit of that strength .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just nodded , too shocked and embarrassed to say anything .
tr	S_VP_.	Finding love with Calvin and friends but without Saint Tropez wealth only thickened the mist of confusion .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it was not an animal .
tr	VP_.	Eaten by lions , or something .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Maybe if Kelly had been close by she could have used those acrylic nails to do the job .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The lawn around the house was well-kept and a circular driveway ran up to the front porch .
tr	NP_VP_.	Mulberry pulled a crowbar out of his bag and approached the first box .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So little time left .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So clothes did make the woman .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I 'm out of here !
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who the hell was this guy ?
tr	S_VP_.	Understanding he 'd done nothing whatsoever to deserve .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The agencies really are so different .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Midweek , he 'd flown to Vegas , hoping the entertainment and companionship out there would put him in a better mood .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she was asked immersion questions .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was happening to him ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once we had people standing right up to the line where the doors shut we started to close them .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That he 'd wanted to share this only with her was more so .
tr	VP_.	Do not feed or molest the animals .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He even has a job at the diner Greyson and I work at .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the truth was that she didn 't want to be alone .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	A lawyer was screaming in a crowded courtroom about something we 'd clearly missed earlier in the episode .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He moved forward to meet her and she noticed the bag in his hand .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he unrolled the condom and stretched it over the outside knob of Lando 's bedroom door .
tr	OTHER	He was just antsy and worried and not getting laid for awhile .
tr	NP_PP_.	The missing blocks of time , the hazy memories .
tr	S_CC_S_.	No one was around and the park was completely vacant .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then policemen came .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Mrs. Jenkin just stood aside , a satisfied little smile on her face .
tr	OTHER	Hour after hour it went on , with a patience that at first terrified and then bored .
tr	NP_VP_.	I was now even more confused .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did Henry write that a man is looking for me ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And finally her dream .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would she have a fire going in the cottage ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On either side was a fence .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she had left in a rush .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he just needed to find an excuse for getting out of the office for a little while .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then he came across a lovely beige sports jacket , made from linen with narrow lapels , a breast pocket and satin lining .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was so unrealistic it hadn 't even made it to my wish list .
tr	NP_PP_.	All that kind of thing .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now he would not look round and see that she was there !
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I thought of all we 'd been through .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she picked her way through the drizzle to study the walls for any symptoms of subsidence , which would never do .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When had I become low enough to snoop in Marcie 's bedroom ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I guess he 's met his match .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What was inside that room was no longer her grandmother .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe she liked brains .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Monday morning couldn 't get here fast enough .
tr	NP_VP_.	I could have sworn she did at the same time .
tr	S_CC_S_.	A few moments passed and the sobbing died away .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they made a rash move .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	To say no would be telling him she enjoyed him .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the yacht was on its way out to sea Connor felt a need to lash out at Andre , but restrained his emotions .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I twisted around and dove .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could the Lycan council sentence Dimitri to such a torturous death and then go to a meeting with the Carpathians discussing becoming allies with them ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we watched Dead Poets Society in Mr. Moreno 's room and left behind a ton of whiteboard markers .
tr	VP_.	said Nomi 's father to the officer .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Hiding behind the collar of his coat he struggled to support himself as the bus changed direction .
tr	OTHER	No cell phones , internet , television , or radio , all gone .
tr	S_VP_.	Focusing on the fact that she thinks I 'm more and hoping I really am .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once she was out she stayed as low as she could .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But you might check with Henry over at the hotel .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then a leopard with a Collar , a smaller bear without one , and finally , Xavier .
tr	S_VP_.	Conventionally moral , dependable , and she 'd had an unexpectedly sly sense of humor .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he opened the door Bryan was sitting on the bed .
tr	NP_VP_.	Annie listened for a few seconds .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had I been thinking ?
tr	NP_VP_.	It would harm me .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his warm , strong hands cupped my face .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And you love your father .
tr	S_VP_.	Should be enough young wolves to be had there , plus the kids who turn into larger shifters .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From left of him Goring spoke up .
tr	VP_.	Nice to have it , though .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe they aren 't so in sync .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he bared his teeth , and just as clearly lost the struggle .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Don 't tell me you 're trying to figure it out .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	There I 'd gone , justifying my horrific actions again .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Dash literally swept her off her feet and right over the edge of the float .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she believe they were meant to be together ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As she approached she startled a family who were lazing in the warm day at a picnic table .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He still wanted her .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The lover he named his own daughter after .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she didn 't want to be alone then .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Long dark hair with just enough curl to make it look messy pulled back in a ponytail .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way he says it makes me think he plans on this happening again .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then he 'd just go find mine .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he began to remove the many weapons he had strapped on his body .
tr	S_VP_.	Enjoyed the novelty of it -- wearing these strange clothes , seeing things I had only ever read about .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She probably thought him a monster , hideous and misshapen .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Hopefully that would keep him from asking any questions about what I did or did not do with DeLuca .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't she be the one person she wanted to be ?
tr	VP_.	Tell them you 're a vampire .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I decide to make him sweat .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What more could I say ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only then did she seem to come to herself and with a shake of her head she entered the Tower and closed the door behind her .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What do you here , mighty kelp ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She barely made it two steps .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	With the shoes also went the last bit of metal on his person save for his coin pouch and the three vials of metals in his belt .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then they came back .
tr	OTHER	No bells and whistles .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there was Taylor and Rampage .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Curiosity finally gripped Cassandra and wouldn 't let go .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing her so happy made me uneasy .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many memories were locked in those frames , reminders that our life together wasn 't always regretful .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she was alone with Him .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That I would fight my own battles and to hell with what the rest of the world said .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe I could .
tr	VP_.	Make no mistake about it .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he fool around with her ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he pulled back and searched her eyes he was all business again .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She was standing where she was before and she bore a grin of self satisfaction .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they suspect her ?
tr	VP_.	Thank you for respecting the hard work of this author .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 15 Daemon I didn 't feel too spiffy .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The TV said you should ignore bullies and they would stop harassing you .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we 'd stayed engaged and postponed the actual marriage .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she feel the strength of the desire pouring from him ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If it was anyone other than Dylan she would .
tr	OTHER	Every day , he thought , it seems like only yesterday .
tr	VP_.	Damn his rotten soul to hell .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In silence he gazed at Reuben , asking nothing , demanding nothing , trusting completely .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I got up , brushed my teeth and washed some dishes while George cried in the studio .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Firmly grasping an edge he tugged until a chunk of at least forty pounds yielded its perch .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When John trotted up beside her she realized she had been holding her breath .
tr	VP_.	Wouldn 't have given her that ultimatum .
tr	VP_.	Make some sense of this nagging physical ache , this overwhelming need , before he woke Jamie and frightened her .
tr	VP_.	Don 't use our own people .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With a flick of his fingers he tossed it away .
tr	S_VP_.	asked the same fake reporter now having everyone 's attention .
tr	OTHER	Do you want to come to my house after school ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Humans still have a tendency to think that good is always pretty and that evil is always ugly .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who am I to judge these people and this world and whether she will be safe here ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once the dishes went flying and the tables cracking there would be no easy way to escape .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I 'll change the name of the company to Mills Communications .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Thirty seconds later they pulled into the parking lot of a well-lit cafe .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The songs I mentioned swirl in and out .
tr	NP_PP_.	A selfish , hateful man who we should never talk about except on Victory Day when we celebrate his death .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe you don 't know why you just don 't give her what she wants ?
tr	NP_VP_.	"Abby said smugly , "" I don 't need luck ."
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that was my dumb heart talking .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But you 're still fat .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Across the road the public gallery was watching this go on .
tr	S_VP_.	Watching her perfectly shaped body in motion made time pass more quickly on the endless roads .
tr	NP_VP_.	I have you again .
tr	OTHER	And the Branch desperately needs the money .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who else would he want ?
tr	NP_PP_.	' Lots of bugs .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where did she fit into the universe ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she show him the same eagerness she always showed him ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Yas did not trust Cassie 's court , did not think the males would defend her properly .
tr	S_VP_.	To say he 'd been shocked would be the understatement of the century .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he pushed his way through the shrubbery he found a bloodied white cloth .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	A smile now replaced the sadness .
tr	VP_.	Name after name after name , running up the side of that wall .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did the words make her shiver with pleasure ?
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting back I studied my work , checking the symmetry of the eye makeup .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I reached over and put my frozen fingers on top of Eva 's hand , the one that was still holding the gun .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was taking her so long ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could such perfectly white skin seem to shine with life ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who would send that amount of flowers and not take credit ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What about any children you might have ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Grant hardly said a word as Jonathan escorted them from room to room , detailing the unique features , of which there were many .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who cares what Haven wants , right ?
tr	NP_VP_.	They would be angry .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe this was the solution to my problems .
tr	S_VP_.	Building a house had been no different to finding the perfect angle for a spoon 's handle .
tr	VP_.	Had known it from the start .
tr	OTHER	But the boy had been earmarked for survival and he was still out there .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could we move so fast without hitting something or someone ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	This seemed the most likely scenario and it was on this thought that he was pondering .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he pulled the hammer back and put the barrel in his mouth .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was she kidding ?
tr	S_VP_.	Blowing off a little steam isn 't going to kill him .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today I went with a root vegetable theme .
tr	NP_VP_.	You want to stick with what 's easy for you .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	CHAPTER 15 Two days later I started cellar duty .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he remembered the papers .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he 'll pay you the journey ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Flash Martin vs. Edgar Hoover .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least that Margie weren 't here .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course I was .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How would she survive on her own ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the hippo was engulfed in a cloud of pale yellow gas .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Lifting her head she glanced around the room , sucking in a deep breath .
tr	OTHER	So much for love them and leave them .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I got sick every time I tried to sift through someone 's memories , that would be one heck of a tell .
tr	S_VP_.	Trying to encourage a feeling that might not be there just to distract her from what you think she 'll do ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The two men left her and retrieved her other bags .
tr	VP_.	Don 't open my eyes .
tr	NP_VP_.	Angela demanded , glancing up from her desk , a shocked look on her face .
tr	OTHER	Was I going to be infected ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she stood at the bar , gripping the wood of the counter as her knuckles turned white .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it 's going to get cold , folks .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But sometimes it 's the unpleasant person who will say what needs saying .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the mutant life cycle is much shorter than a normal human 's .
tr	OTHER	And call me Kenny around here .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Few people these days were aware that rowan wood had often been used by druids for staves .
tr	NP_PP_.	No guilt or remorse about what I had just handed him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So there was a whole other aspect of facing the unknown beyond their mountain valley .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Not if the thing within me has any say in it .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What we see should not be possible .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the head lay quietly back again in rest .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only he didn 't count on the economy being this bad and lasting this long .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I want something to drink ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who did he invite this time ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If the PCs choose to fight the Death Knights they come in infinite squads of 10 in as many groups as you wish .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	To each name she imagined a face and a story until the whole graveyard was full of people .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Several times I 'd had to stop myself from telling my sister about Mom 's troubles .
tr	S_VP_.	To break in one required a crowbar .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I eagerly eye the sliced tomato and candied walnuts .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not every child made it .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Nothing clean about it but the job would be done .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell was wrong with a pink Cadillac ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If this was one of those moments she wanted to be awake .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Usually I have to take a number , a high number , and wait before I get a chance to hold him or read him a story .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What scares me the most is that I 'm afraid the only side of her I do know ... doesn 't really exist at all .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he supposed to care ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After that I had to send two new Generals out into the field for their first taste of combat .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she wanted one to stand by her side and share her life , just as her mother had .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell was wrong with him ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he ran as fast as he could , getting as far as a couple kilometres in around 10 seconds .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did he give me this shield ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now he could see it , as if the tree had finally consented .
tr	S_VP_.	To go to the colony could lead to his contracting of the wasting disease .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If they were afraid of me in any way they would let me see her .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was this not the final cut ?
tr	S_VP_.	Since when had he ever blown off work ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know every person is a walking jungle of bacteria ?
tr	VP_.	Come to me , brothers and sisters .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What sort of man was this who would throw aside love for duty ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" The Turn of the Screw ."
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she oscillate between David and Gill , sexually promiscuous ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she really want to risk starting a new cycle ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I don 't know what to tell him about the aftermath of killing a person .
tr	OTHER	How proprietary was this cousin ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though witnessing what unfolded seemed to contradict that .
tr	NP_PP_.	This Gift of Joy 38 .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	In some ways she was hoping they 'd tell her he went through women like water .
tr	OTHER	They both lay there together , feeling good they 'd managed to satisfy each other and express their overflowing love .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a few minutes she watched them before turning back to her drink .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she looked at the grub again .
tr	OTHER	Over two hours by train ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today the stranger 's hand cuts free the past .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I sense rather than see her close the distance to stand right behind me .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where are you going ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I was younger I wouldn 't have given him a second look .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	They weren 't drawings , or at least not any sort of drawing she had ever seen .
tr	S_VP_.	Warning : This is the first book in The Healer Series and may be left open ended .
tr	NP_VP_.	Singer raised his head , his eyes groggy .
tr	VP_.	said the dark hair girl , tall teenager .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Either way she did not like it .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had I refused ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The home he 'd foolishly made for her .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Good luck with that ."
tr	NP_VP_.	Cynthia relaxed her grip and held me at arm 's length .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Back and forth Ren paced , his agitation manifesting itself in the brisk way he moved .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I have been looking for the man with grey eyes and black hair that looks blue in some lighting .
tr	NP_PP_.	Bad news for the Land League , unless some suicidal Irishman exacted justice in London .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just knew that once he closed that door , I would never see him again .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have a death wish ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I 'm not sure how far I will get on my own .
tr	S_VP_.	To call him corpulent would be an injustice .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps I should train Prudence in covert operation procedures ?
tr	S_VP_.	Pushing my right fingers under the cuff on my left wrist was painful , but not unbearable .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he gently lifted her to her feet .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she going to do , shoot him ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he not want to make a move ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they shall see all that is true , Why love was lost , avenged by you .
tr	NP_VP_.	The corners of his lips turned up in a smile .
tr	VP_.	Eloise clung to his neck and screamed in his ear , bringing his mind back to attention .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she had the same overwhelming feelings he had about her .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That he came on to you .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He looked into her eyes and it wasn 't possible to guess what he was thinking .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Julian stayed with me .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I got to his home I discovered much had changed .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes it was easy to unravel the hurt , as it had been with Ronan last night , sometimes impossible .
tr	OTHER	And I just want to be around you .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	They wanted to keep it as evidence in case you 'd need it .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she slid her hand in the bag , through the open zipper , and was happy to find the books they had provided .
tr	VP_.	Lips as full as Ashton 's .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His eyes were closed and his lips trailed over her face .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He ´ s also known for making other kids pay for any injustice that may have occurred amongst any of our fellow classmates .
tr	S_CC_S_.	A jolting shiver washed down my back and I was sure I would be sick for a few moments .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But mostly we were ignored , although some of them were clearly amused by seeing an old Senator on a horse .
tr	NP_VP_.	It was when her aunt tried to make her sleep with a man for money that she ran away .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The last few days he had been extremely emotional .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we spent the rest of summer preparing for the party .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing those comments made me want to walk away from him ... forever .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he really dead while he slept , or merely trapped in the darkness , aware of what went on around him , but unable to respond ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	His gaze never left Cara 's .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was more enticing than a prey that was clever enough to put up a struggle ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she truly curious or did she wish to know for the Hunters ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every time I opened the kitchen door I swore I could smell the Blue Mountain coffee he was so fond of .
tr	NP_PP_.	A loathsome killer of human beings .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How dare he bring up Sam and assume that 's where all my messed up issues came from .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Glancing at the car 's digital clock it read twelve thirteen .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was going on ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his companions to be silent .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she turned around .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he looked away , then loosened my wrists and pushed himself up .
tr	VP_.	Don 't use the middle shower , but swim in the middle lane and wear a cap , but get her hair completely wet first .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The one man he trusted above all the others .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she 'd turned to Everett days later , proving to Rand that his judgment concerning Tara was faulty .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	""" Nothing yet "" he replied ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this was how it felt to truly love another person .
tr	NP_VP_.	Some cultures believe you 're not a true man until you 've drank your first pint with your older self acting as the legal guardian .
tr	VP_.	Keeping tabs on him ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	She herself would never change shape , since she was not the firstborn child .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	"If they both return then my life is once more complete "" said Uncle Malik ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At river crossings fords were impossible .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way he groaned my name caused shivers of desire to race up and down my spine .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What Braden had said was so clear the town drunk would have figured it out almost immediately .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	I myself was a part of the change .
tr	NP_VP_.	We were silent for a long time , thinking about the implications of what she said .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did it matter ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If she stayed there she was going to die .
tr	VP_.	Don 't be afraid to show your big sister some spice kicking action .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I was tempted to , as I realized abruptly that I wanted nothing so much as to get the hell out of town .
tr	NP_PP_.	No difference between this and any other given morning .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He slowly eased his hand towards his weapon .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I look in the distance behind them I see a horde of ghouls trudging after the caravan .
tr	NP_VP_.	This particular Nix had taken the life of her neighbor Mrs. Basso .
tr	OTHER	Must a person always try to find a hole for every peg ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Searing pleasure rushed through her and she pressed her face onto his chest .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he straightened and met Samantha 's eyes .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could someone who was supposed to love me do something so cruel ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least the dirty water had to be a lot better than the chunks of dirt that were on the white root vegetables .
tr	OTHER	But most the time .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did Rand have to take up the sword ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She 'd asked him that before .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She barely remembered pushing the End button on her phone and slipping it into her purse but she must have .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But maybe it had been more than that .
tr	OTHER	But his head ... his head HURT , more than it had hurt in longer than he could remember .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because he was a teenage boy and I basically climbed him like a tree and assaulted his mouth .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knew a bunch of upper crust stiffs could throw such a great bash ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When thee man he comes and he say much work , much dollars , our father he say ' good ' .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was I doing this to myself ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I told them to go ahead .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now she couldn 't remember when the next meeting would be held .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the colour seemed to shift and hide , become more human .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What remains of your armies are gathered in the desert .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she wrapped her arms about his neck and pulled him closer .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now Marcus smiled , too , and drove his hand into the silky thatch of curls hiding the feminine core of her .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Crushing their wolf helms like tin cans and spewing their innards out of their suits of armor in a geyser of black goo .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How much of the immortal world has been out there right under my nose all this time ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many people came in and out of my life .
tr	OTHER	But Fire only moaned that , far from being terrified of his power , they flung him from their catapults at enemy ships .
tr	VP_.	Asked the constable calmly .
tr	S_VP_.	Being wrapped up in his arms took my pain away .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she trails a hand down my shoulder .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her blonde , wispy hair was hanging around her shoulders and she came up to me with a big hug .
tr	NP_PP_.	Out of the question .
tr	VP_.	Go back to the house and get the wheel barrow .
tr	S_VP_.	Don 't even try to argue it was an accident !
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How has my lovely wife upset you ?
tr	S_VP_.	""" Don 't -- "" I smiled at his modesty , which seemed to stun him ."
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I never knew what effort there could be in building perfection , and how hollow it may seem .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a short while the ship would pass the final signal buoys and leave the finite , familiar universe behind .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What on earth could make Douglas Ashton 's renowned composure slip ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he supposed to be intimidated ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	My eyes widened and breath escaped me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he thrust two fingers inside her and stroked her inner walls , then back to her clit until she thought she 'd scream .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was this fair ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where were my powers ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he took her set and reached for her left hand .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Jake and I looked up at the intruder and I tensed .
tr	OTHER	On the way to the tractor barn Watkins talked about country artists he admired .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Either way the outcome would leave her empty .
tr	S_VP_.	Being abandoned by them felt like losing the warm embrace of a once loving mother .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With her ear pressed against his chest she heard a low rumble .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Though her mortal life she learned much , the knife and the bow .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the boy know the sickly man on the other side of the bars was his father ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How dare you include him in something dangerous ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now I see that the pretty girls don 't have everything .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In only the last year he 'd been approached twice by keen fathers , making it known that Sam would be a welcome son-in-law .
tr	S_VP_.	Promise me that you 'll stop letting your parents ' ignorance hurt you so much .
tr	NP_VP_.	The French built the largest balloon .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With the others in view but out the way he handed Barry a pair of tatty sparring gloves .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course I would win .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had I left home without a single piece of candy ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her hands cupped his face and she gazed into his eyes , dark now with desire .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was Nick seriously considering what Grand was saying ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She was so used to staying in hotels like this one she tended to forget that not everyone in the world was blase about a penthouse .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why do you want to help me ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He only continued to watch her with glowing amber eyes and an unreadable expression stretched across his handsome face .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she to do ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he 's leaving unsaid .
tr	VP_.	Walked down the hall a short distance and examined one of the portraits hanging there .
tr	NP_VP_.	There was no response .
tr	NP_VP_.	I must know you 're there all the time .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With each stroke of sound little lines began to appear on the left side wall , floating there as if in mid-air .
tr	NP_VP_.	he uttered too quickly .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's that have to do with me ?
tr	OTHER	Relief at being assured of Nicole 's well-being mixed with confusion over what had happened to him .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though I shortly had to fight my way out of his embrace in order to breathe .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Against the wind they 'd done well to keep some track of her seven .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" The happiest year of my life ."
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But this kind of terrible events take place everyday in some parts of the world .
tr	OTHER	Maybe a strange sighting here , a portal being captured on video there .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What in the world could she do to help a man like him ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I really say that ?
tr	OTHER	And will you cut your parents some slack too ?
tr	OTHER	But Ryder also wasn 't in the mood to get staked .
tr	VP_.	Make him find someone else to handle this ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He faithfully promised he would .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they take in girls as well as boys ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And a part of me was worried that he wouldn 't be able to sense when to stop , what with his brain on sensory overload .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon he had her moaning and thrashing about .
tr	S_VP_.	Kicking off she did the width of the pool before swimming lengthways .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he was very needy .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It seems like the houses across the street are all lightly colored and the oceanfront properties are all brightly colored .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the LORD God said unto the woman , What is this that thou hast done ?
tr	OTHER	The pilot greeted us and then we settled into the luxurious seats , buckling our seatbelts .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What they say does not matter .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We also enjoy snooping on regular Earth folks , following their every movement while they perform what you would consider to be rather mundane events .
tr	S_VP_.	Calling out was a waste of breath .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Next time he came through here he needed to find it .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she had a point .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I supposed , if it came to it , it was a moral sort of cheating .
tr	S_VP_.	Showing some concern for his missing sister would buy him some much-needed time .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If asked this question previously I would have sworn an oath that there would be tears , confessions , hugs and perhaps even remorse .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you find her ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he know that ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I didn 't have to , not when absent sports banners and the glares of former fair-weather friends kept all of it so fresh in my mind .
tr	NP_VP_.	Dreamer put the house phone down as he started laughing .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As if she 'd ever done what was expected of her .
tr	NP_PP_.	The most unlikely of partners .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What am I doing ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The rest she remembered with crystal clarity .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The long lashes fluttered and she looked away .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like a breaching seal I rose , and came streaming to my feet .
tr	NP_VP_.	She looked away as she spoke .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Her head swam , her heartbeat quickened into a racing gallop and by the time he broke away , she was laboring for breath .
tr	NP_PP_.	The formal name for a Pleasure Poppet .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I know a demon 's true nature is not human .
tr	OTHER	Please see your doctor when you return home .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I teach you nothing ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Around midnight he got out of bed and dressed .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he didn 't have to stare into his victim 's eyes .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Abruptly Feingold and Charney stopped paying Hennessey 's bills .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She probably looked like a damn gaunt scarecrow .
tr	NP_VP_.	He changed into a dry jacket and carefully pushed the damp one under Gwyn 's head .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	but Simon decided not to continue .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Thomas : Why are we in here , anyway ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I do want you to feel .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I can hear Dante behind me and I can hear him calling my name .
tr	S_VP_.	Getting an education was a bit like a communicable sexual disease .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much had happened since my father took his life .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then you would have been on top of our list , without question .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Somehow Thomas couldn 't remember anything like this ever happening to Indiana Jones .
tr	OTHER	I could do the same , I suppose , but that wasn 't always effective .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Four green girls in white frilly dresses nervously walked up to him .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then people started recognizing him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After almost two hours Riley was called in .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Although he never hosts any functions there anymore .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who talks like this in real life ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Darius asked from the other room .
tr	OTHER	The movement of his jaw , his short breath , his furrowed brow -- all belied his earlier , offhand manner .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the meantime she told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I concentrated on exactly how and where he was standing .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she remembered , and slipped her hand under the silky , flowing skirts to tug free the wooden stake she 'd slipped into her garter .
tr	NP_PP_.	Top of his class .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he said that no one could touch the powder from the pill .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She had to admit to herself she loved his hands and mouth on her .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was her father 's Book of Shadows the book Justinian started ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I relayed that .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What on earth is she doing with him ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If it was a lie , then the man was to be pitied .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Jared casually sipped from his cup .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I tried again with you .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"When she went inside she said , "" I hope you don 't mind that I left early for lunch ."
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Next morning she found , in the wreckage of the dressing table , a number of diaries , which had spilt from a hidden drawer .
tr	S_VP_.	Being in Italy had helped her heal .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They always ran before .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Dressed in a pair of jeans I used to wear when I spent summers on my grandfather 's ranch .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But her father , Brian , had gritted his teeth and told the story .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As I drove up in front of the Plaza of the Americas I noticed Kurt right behind me in his Maserati .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he take a girl from Hope Center ?
tr	VP_.	Assume they 'll be here any second .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When we entered the visiting room reception area I noticed the same guard was on duty again .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he stops , still as a statue .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Here I was worried by none of that .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever lived here was not going to help us .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He began to talk about his garden and the flowers he had planted this summer .
tr	OTHER	But then his hot mouth closed over her nipple and she could no longer speak .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And there you have it .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever I 'm laying on doesn 't feel like a bed anymore .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Tomorrow there would be enough time to deal with all her feelings he evoked .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How long ago did you find out that the girl had been found ?
tr	OTHER	Tucker both believed him and knew he was right .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she walked toward us , stretching out the hand holding the medallion .
tr	NP_PP_.	Members of the media who were here to cover the event .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she must want to talk , want it desperately .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That way he gained his friends ' trust .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Or was it his own arrest that he was flying back toward ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With a single look she had awakened a feral need smoldering beneath the surface .
tr	NP_PP_.	A time for new and better heroes .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I screamed every argument at myself I could think of , every truth and lie I had been convincing myself of ever since we met .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we need not worry with these smaller countries , ' he paused , ' until we come to Sweden .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Then the faint feeling of unease in his gut turned foul and his expression blackened .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did my grandfather know what terror these people would inflict upon me ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had he left her ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he finished he walked off through the house to look around .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What should he call the child ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's the use of trying to tell him anything ?
tr	VP_.	Combine this with the fact that he has forgotten to shave for several days running , and you have the personification of a stereotypical Cambridge academic .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I 'm going to give it to you .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Mom won 't really kick me out .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And all she knew was that he was looking at her as if she was the only person in the world who mattered .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why don 't you come to the hospice tomorrow and tell him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	You shoulda persuaded harder .
tr	VP_.	Stroll down the beach .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I couldn 't take my eyes off her .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it was pitch-black .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I clench my fists and try not to scream and I tuck my friends in my heart and revenge I think has never looked so sweet .
tr	S_VP_.	Trying to twist this amazing thing into that something ugly .
tr	S_VP_.	Then leaning over he whispered in her ear that he could not believe what a small world they all lived in .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because that 's what happened .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did she want this time to go ?
tr	VP_.	To feel if his lips were as soft as they looked .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Christmas morning would mean a lot for many people .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did he look so upset ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why is everything always in the last place we look ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Since very few had tubs it took the hands of several to soak and wring out the washcloths , to scrub all the unreachable parts .
tr	OTHER	Alex and Amy both congratulated her , clamoring for more details .
tr	S_VP_.	Being a vampire didn 't look like such a terrible thing not the way the Cullens did it , anyway .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By noon there wouldn 't be a stray bean anywhere .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Kara is twenty-five .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then something poked at my sore stomach .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He never called when he was with her .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	We have been monitoring our friends the Fosters and things have just gotten much , much worse .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it rude to wish they would meet their demise sooner rather than later ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I then came to the realization of what an obstinate fool I had been for my entire life .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Mostly now I repair boats .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even his handwriting had improved .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Asking about me ?"
tr	VP_.	Let someone else do the thinking and provide the meals .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	That was a very personal question from someone she 'd just met .
tr	NP_PP_.	Out of my own skin .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it made me feel ... weird .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Simon led them back to the train station and they boarded a train that was outbound towards the rim wall .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it stretched out toward him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	CD always taught that they had to concentrate on the possible and make do .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As I approached the gate I heard barking and immediately recognized Goldie 's bark .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way he arched his back and tilted his head back as he drove into me from below .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you see her eyes ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Three days later Brady left Bogotá with Frank 's signed affiliation document in his briefcase .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he needed was to get back to the hotel and discuss all this with Taylor Hayes .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I just mention her ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	* Iseo walked to a hammock draped between two barren trees .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When had she started to think of her house as his home , too ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did the house 's occupant manage to keep all of these Old World items working and in such pristine shape ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it should be long enough .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Just once I want to sleep and wake up new .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he began to burn .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Although what more they could give her she did not know .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Good thing I paid attention this morning when we left .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The idea of leaving the cottage undefended made her uneasy but the notion of actually spending the night there gave her the jitters .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What does that mean ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it occurred to her .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As he finished speaking he was suddenly transported back to his youth .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I 'm sure I looked exactly like someone who was trying hard not to cry .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he kissed her , harder , longer and wetter before he let her go and went back to his desk .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he not view her as a woman ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The past and the future already happened .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But surely he 'd seen by now that she was more than just another debutante .
tr	NP_VP_.	He 's not just young , but also obnoxious .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knew how he would react to his new life .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I remember to shut the door ?
tr	OTHER	Because I 'm lonely and vulnerable .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	"This morning he was wearing a black woollen jumper "" replied Kiara excited by the tip ."
tr	OTHER	And who was I to dispute his attempt at making this friendship work ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now he had his arms crossed and was leaning back against the wall , looking at her .
tr	OTHER	And yet one monster still remained , lurking in the dark recesses of that same room , keeping itself warm in the glow of the flame .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What does it matter if they do it unintentionally ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At first he thought it was deserted .
tr	NP_VP_.	I kept concentrating on his brain to see whether he could receive any signals from me that way .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Once again she 'd run off to enjoy her life while leaving her kids behind to figure things out .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or at least she prepared to .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The eyes went cunning and she saw the gaze lock on Nicolas 's throat .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Not because he lacked an opinion , but because no matter what Kelsey and Robles concluded Gage had already decided on a battle plan .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When Leonard won the hand the room breathed a sigh of relief .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I couldn 't allow that to happen .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I swear to myself I won 't let this happen .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This morning he 'd woken her up a second time to make love to her .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Corsair was staring at Trapper with his mouth hanging open and Sole had an expression that was a cross between a smile and disbelief .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Nor the back-up tape recorders soaking up every word .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She stares at me sadly and for a minute , I 'm bothered .
tr	S_VP_.	Talking about Elizabeth 's own childhood made that possibility seem tantalizingly real .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they call you Scarlet now , do they ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	My grandmother poured me another generous portion of her whiskey and I knocked this one back just as quickly as its predecessor .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What does she need to do ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The things she could do to that fantastic body .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you must be careful .
tr	OTHER	If you could call it a garden .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	There they lost them .
tr	NP_VP_.	Wesley toured the third world .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Resting my chin on my knees I sighed .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As we stood holding each other I looked over Jessie 's shoulder and watched as the smoking air filter caught fire again .
tr	S_VP_.	Can 't wait to get started .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A stroke of pure luck it had impacted where it had .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell was wrong with me ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this is how it would be from now on .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did he know we were here ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Matara was no longer that shining , inspiring , safe place it had been .
tr	S_VP_.	Watched with interest as her pupils dilated .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the village again which worried Brother George .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If we don 't go now Blake will surely come out anytime now .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Only after I heard her strike a match did I dare peek out from underneath the covers .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it stopped , just as the round toes of the red Mary Janes were visible beneath my stall door , facing directly towards me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It finally got to the point where she couldn 't take it anymore and had to start getting her thoughts down on paper .
tr	OTHER	Banged up metal lockers ran across one wall , doors missing on some of them .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is taking Tucker so long ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	The glue gun was ready and a small pool of the glue had hardened on the table attached by a spider strand of glue to the tip .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so they might be sympathetic to us .
tr	OTHER	Beneath their feet the ground suddenly shook , heaved and bucked , rolled perilously .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though it didn 't sound like a request .
tr	NP_VP_.	It was nearly three feet long , was covered in carvings , and wrapped in bead work .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who could have tipped them off ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so my fruit fell and lay on the grass or was tossed from hand to hand by Eve and Adam .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With a shudder I remember how the thing mangled his arm , how I used it on other human beings .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	My scowl tells him it is .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Hugh knew it was his time to stand up and stop this nonsense .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	he asked , the sparkle in his eyes telling her he was enjoying this .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the need to touch and claim her rides me hard .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he walked toward table number three .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so he did .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could one man have such an impact on her ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had she gone through the trouble at all of getting dressed up and then waiting for him ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I get back to the table Mason has paid the bill and is waiting for me at the bar .
tr	VP_.	Let 's all get some rest and regroup here in the morning .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In his heart he knew that the Templars and all the evil they represented were not finished .
tr	NP_PP_.	The self-hatred burning in his eyes .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His eyes were barely open and I could tell he was in terrible pain .
tr	S_VP_.	Replacing it was a large , dark hole .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I have a real bad feelin ' every time I go out the door .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He 'd have to expose himself at that point and that 's when Chad would take his shot .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The silence we created with Sebastian , that singularity that came from you and him and me .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the man have a conscience ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night she had seen how Noah still looked at her with kindness after that stupid moment in the bar .
tr	NP_PP_.	A last howl of rage .
tr	NP_VP_.	A second mistake deserved punishment .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"If he ever gets out - "" I 'm a dead woman ."
tr	S_VP_.	Soothing mandolin , harp , and flute music played over the sound of a roaring ocean .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The two them performed flawlessly .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One minute I was sleeping comfortably in my chair .
tr	NP_PP_.	The hoarseness in that deep voice .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The entire scene , what was happening , what he was saying , it was all too bizarre , too strange , too unbelievable .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the haar had come in .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where the hell was she ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It came to me that he was the man who 'd been working out with Darcy Orchard the day Jim Box had been out with the flu .
tr	VP_.	Thank you for respecting the hard work of this author .
tr	VP_.	Try to make it to one of the villages ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Over twenty-four hours had passed since she 'd left 1576 and taken her first trip through time .
tr	NP_VP_.	It had already written itself .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I continued on , finishing up a tale that Boyd had yet to deny .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At last I sat cross-legged , looking through the slider at the back yard .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you stop to think what this would do to him ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he stroked the tender flesh inside her opposite arm .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For the Christians and the Jews did not participate in the city 's celebrations .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He closed his eyes and Dante listened to his father 's story .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Some of them he paid .
tr	VP_.	My crazy , erratic and heartbroken mom .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Another reason he was considering this .
tr	NP_PP_.	a pile of blackened rubble ... .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he 'd slowly baked in the sun until Misty made him drink water a Fae had given her .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After one argument he said I argued like a philosopher and that I should think about enrolling for graduate work .
tr	NP_VP_.	I shook my head and made my way to class .
tr	OTHER	Is it worth to kill you ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	He has disappeared and his family fears the worst .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Still she would be here for him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just knew he was there , the same way I had known that he was a Vampire .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was almost as good as Allison 's he said .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And we 'd stood in relative peace the past fifteen minutes .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he pointed at a three-letter word with a dinner fork icon in it .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She only led because he didn 't know where they were going .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In fact they came to be friends .
tr	S_VP_.	Raised to protect , to never let go of the beautiful Kingdom within .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I almost felt sorry for him .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe he had .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	( Two Weeks Later ) Chuck and Gail were cruising along lazily down the river front highway on the east side of West Creek County .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she took command .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Which fit her better ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Later that night the new folks arrived and were introduced as the Jenson family .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Took from you ?"
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I was shaking so hard my teeth were clicking together .
tr	S_CC_S_.	All she wanted was to get over John and start getting on with her life but it seemed her mind had other ideas .
tr	OTHER	Just like the one in front of her .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Casting one final gaze around him Stephens turned and trudged in through the door .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The girl hastily crossed her arms over her chest as his gaze narrowed .
tr	OTHER	And how long has it been going on ?
tr	OTHER	""" Just as well ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he showed them in , full of confident bravado and helpfulness , and invited them to search .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did he want from her ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What kind of blood was it ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could you have already been married ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Yes I 'm sure that it would be good news , whatever it was .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	an apartment she saw in the paper .
tr	NP_VP_.	Her burned hand hit the console hard , keeping double time with her words .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps she had ruined the suspense of his story .
tr	NP_VP_.	Some did it better than others .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I want to sit here for a while longer .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	There it was , an exchange of her challenge for mine .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet it felt odd when Vivian thanked him politely and edged away as if they hadn 't made love several times .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because they were seen once in a toga back in the day doesn 't mean that 's all they wear .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was he supposed to function today when he so desperately wanted a woman who was now off limits ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would Della 's phone be disconnected ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I couldn 't convince myself he was lying .
tr	S_VP_.	asked Gregor , not letting go .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When her bottom smacked the door she realized there was nowhere to go , nowhere to hide .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she mistaken or was he becoming a lot less friendly ?
tr	VP_.	Pictured here with her mother , Isabel Randall , and Ms. Randall 's fiance , Tom Marin .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the guards drop in the pellets that turn to gas when they get wet .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now the real test would come .
tr	S_VP_.	Could be they were looking for you ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least he 'd tried to tell them -- several times .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Slowly I sat up .
tr	NP_PP_.	Stop thinking about him !
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she up to ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Bradley felt very competitive when he heard that James could develop so many ideas from the books , while he , Bradley , didn 't .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I reach out to touch her arm and she jumps .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But what stopped me was the thought of my parents .
tr	NP_VP_.	I 'll have to bring Mia and Melissa up here sometime and watch them swoon .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But maybe this was why .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I have to think about the fact that every time we touch , I get this burning sensation that is getting stronger .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And you 've apparently found Hecate .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I understood was that his calm demeanor suggested he was well trained , and probably a deadly shot .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I focused on not passing out from the moment Nicolai showed up .
tr	NP_VP_.	The dealer finished the shuffling and dealt the cards .
tr	VP_.	Don 't approach her again unless you 're in it for good .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How often does he come here ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For lunch I 'd had a pack of crackers .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In such cramped confines John took a beating , and was bleeding profusely when the police rescued him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She then turned her head and looked out the window to the fields .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I have been so stupid ?
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting on the couch cuddling with my boyfriend helped me keep my fear at bay .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she 'd gotten sick again .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When all hope is lost .
tr	NP_VP_.	A shiny black van with tinted windows rolled slowly their way , headlights glaring through the bushes like the eyes of some possessed beast .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	"For starters my jacket says PET "" A "" on the back ."
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they feel they were part of something ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But nine was old enough to understand that the whispers she frequently heard about her mother weren 't particularly flattering .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't they just let her be ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She wasn 't sure how she 'd react to him , given that she believed him to be one of the reasons her sister ran off .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Plenty of times ."
tr	S_VP_.	Turns out we have the same business hours .
tr	NP_PP_.	or words to that effect .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was it called again ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the universe is infinitely patient .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes I 'd think I was just this eighth-grade pain in the ass , this little sister , this pest .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I did it took us a while to make it out of the bedroom .
tr	VP_.	Ending up in the office twice in the same week .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	The more we watched the dragons the more ridiculous it seemed that they could ever harm us .
tr	NP_PP_.	His kind of trouble .
tr	VP_.	Watching each other 's backs .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe there weren 't any right words .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When Maryellen closed the pantry door she was not thinking about being hungry .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he vows to make Danny come tomorrow , and even decides to accompany him , if need be .
tr	NP_VP_.	There are tons of openings between the leaves at the bottom of the card .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least she never used to .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It all swirled together in a burst of images I hadn 't really thought out .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The birds were in long lines and more of them seemed to be alighting on the island every moment and joining these lines .
tr	NP_PP_.	Just not for his own .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For Wil had joined a small group on a Monday night at 6 PM for a chant and sit quietly listening to the Guru give a lesson .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Up river there was a government check point , for the waterway was strategic .
tr	S_VP_.	Please please please not Adam I 'd been too optimistic about today .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If Jason thought Cheating at Solitaire 87 I was living with another man , who knows what hell he 'd raise .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because you 're fast and strong , and no one knows where you 'll strike .
tr	VP_.	Boom , boom , boom .
tr	OTHER	At the far corner was a water closet and another entrance to the bath .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But again there was no answer .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If he was going to be heard over the guitar he needed to sing louder .
tr	NP_PP_.	Kissing Thayer for the first time , and the second , and the third .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But a corner of his mind took in her words .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Love , Blake She knew he was in trouble the moment she opened it .
tr	NP_VP_.	He heard a squeaky , rattling sound from somewhere overhead , near the back of the ledge .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so it went with every transaction Joanna witnessed .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	His expression tight with regret , March shakes his head .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	No Sorry or Hope you don 't die .
tr	VP_.	Had to hold her close constantly .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In one slick move Scorch had her pressed against the wall .
tr	NP_VP_.	I should have realized though that I wasn 't really ready or stable enough to know myself , let alone share a life with another person .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did you do it ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was Kenny up to with all this interrogation ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I didn 't think of him as family I would have decked him several times already .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Between Earth and Heaven There 's no need to apologize .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I really expect to track down the bastard who did this ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now I 'm good .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now you just need to practice .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Apparently they didn 't want to risk stopping in the city .
tr	VP_.	To let herself be held .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How come everyone else seemed able to ignore the comments except her ?
tr	VP_.	See you in a couple of hours .
tr	OTHER	Would I have picked up a liking for sweater dresses and big hair too ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I think anyone had paid attention to me when I 'd said that before ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only Zev talked to him and encouraged him .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it 's simply the way the world looks through the cold , driving rain .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she pulled Charlotta forward with her and pushed Romulus .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That he couldn 't reach out and touch her .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because they thought their secret enclave was just that , secret and hidden deep in the woods , at the bottom of the gorge .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What exactly does she know of him ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Well most likely she didn 't want a bigger room .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She 'd sounded depressed about the decision Jacqueline and Susan had made regarding it .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After reading the group 's other two fliers Randolph knew no more about the point of the whole thing than he had after the first one .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If only the dragon were ugly or somehow repulsive .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Outwardly the woman extolled all the virtues of the perfect woman .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	My roommates always knew how to put me in a good mood .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Time passes quickly and we reach the stubby plant I have come to know and kind of like on the outskirts of the lake .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he spoke he reached up a hand , pinching first one nipple and then the other .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't we leave sooner ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I felt Galen come in behind Rhys and hold him too .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We arrived at the car and I helped Clare buckle a sleeping Maddie into the car seat .
tr	OTHER	That room that 's boarded up or walled in or something .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Cupping his hands over her breasts he cradled them , measuring their weight as her nipples hardened under his fingertips .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that beautiful chest of his could belong to a fireman or a soldier or a guy who just enjoyed working out in the gym .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she leaned over and touched Spencer 's eyes , as if to close them .
tr	NP_PP_.	Damsel in distress ... ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	"Where is the "" evidence of the great conspiracy you see all around you ?"
tr	VP_.	Pull back my arms .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he caught himself .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And still the stench grew .
tr	NP_VP_.	A fury that matched mine .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How would Amber explain ?
tr	VP_.	Ironic that a note about marriage and happiness should appear on my screen at that very moment .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now they 've found her .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he going to do with her ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I was hoping the fact that we were undeniably in love with one another put the odds on our side .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The walk back to the hotel felt far too short .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was that the sense of something more that I had felt about him when I 'd entered the room , the smell that had made me sick ?
tr	OTHER	And how scared you are for her .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because brown leather cover didn 't exactly narrow things down when it came to books .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even though she smiles and thanks them politely I can sense that she doesn 't want to be here .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she mostly talked on the phone , emailed , or surfed the internet looking for pieces for her clients .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she supposed to do ?
tr	NP_VP_.	David lowered the flowers and smiled - a gorgeous smile that melted her heart .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By the time summer 's over Cam will be far enough along to be safe .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I rolled to my back and examined the state of my stomach .
tr	NP_VP_.	He was about to go drag her down the stairs himself when a hush fell over the room .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he was one of those men who actually fell in love with all his mistresses to some degree .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe the guards won 't let her in .
tr	S_VP_.	Being a coward wasn 't part of it .
tr	S_VP_.	Passing the ball out to Billy meant sending it further from the goal .
tr	OTHER	Particularly in his current , inebriated state .
tr	NP_VP_.	Nothing penetrated through the shards of pain splintering through my head .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I thanked her , touched her hand , gave her a solid wink , and made my way toward security .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did they want from me ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Brethren of the same light .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I looked up at Victoria from the chair I was sitting on with my heart beating faster and nervousness conquering my entire body .
tr	NP_VP_.	"She understood most of it , though some words , like "" bunker "" and "" outbreak , "" she hadn 't seen before ."
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did I do that ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I asked her where you went she said she thought you were headed to the gym .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I remember going to the bookstore the minute it opened on the release date of each new book .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell are you doing here ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But maybe you could try to be nice to Brody ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there was nothing at all .
tr	NP_VP_.	That was the first and last time I 'll ever be used by anybody .
tr	OTHER	And now before my eyes was standing a man of fog claiming the same name and title , so bizarre .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because you do it not just to turn me on but because you are intrinsically sexy .
tr	NP_VP_.	He 'd always loved the drive , the long stretch of highway cutting the almost impossibly flat valley with the blue gray mountains climbing on either side .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I should do is scare the holy hell out of him so he will get over this nonsense .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing my stepfather take those punches kindled an anger in me .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I thought you were Dad telling me I was messing up again .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did everyone see it ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last night he got better and left .
tr	OTHER	Too busy figuring out a date , she didn 't explain .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did I ask him where the library was ?
tr	OTHER	When I saw more bruises .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By this time Marcia had been awakened by the ruckus and was wailing from her crib in the next room .
tr	VP_.	said Bruce , delighted .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But we 're having dinner tonight .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As I became more accustomed to this body I was able to focus more on what was going on inside his head .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	All of a sudden he had a limit ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Throughout that day I watched him whenever I could .
tr	NP_PP_.	Son of a bitch .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I couldn 't forget some stranger 's eyes ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Searching for Closure Tuesday 11th September 1990 When Max returned to the family room he was pleased to see the evidence that Caroline had started reading .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was he taking Stacy out when she was Ian 's latest fling ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she possibly even think of leaving him when he was like this ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now she was being forced to realize he was also devoted to his family .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At night she could see the lights of the Chicago skyline in the distance over the top of the buildings across the street .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	After he saw to her wound .
tr	OTHER	Then a few minutes later my mother came in with another cup of coffee and tried to wake me up .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That they hadn 't got her to their broadcasting equipment yet .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know they lied to us ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the kitchen I peered into the refrigerator .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he just happened to show up .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If she comes I need to have something built so she will stay .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She really wanted a piece .
tr	OTHER	Not a soul on the battlements .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he went to the desk and yanked open the drawers dumping the contents on the floor .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was this the emotion he was talking about ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	She screams and her face looks up at me , begging me to pull her up .
tr	NP_VP_.	It would be introduced into their cities .
tr	VP_.	Should get better acquainted .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Only after they left did I realize that the Dean of the Covenant was supplying alcohol to minors .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night she went to Daphne 's house .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How often did they update ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Jonesy went about getting into the air in other ways .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing him again had simply stirred old memories , like dust in an unused room .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She glared at him just in case he was reading her mind , to show him she meant business .
tr	S_VP_.	Shake until frosty , pour into an appropriate glass , and drop in a blue cheese stuffed olive .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she grew up and had five kids .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it stops hurting as a warm flush spreads through me because I 'm going to that place again .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just enough time to satisfy the craving he 'd created more than a year ago .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Further down that block was the Italian restaurant his father sometimes visited for lunch .
tr	OTHER	Do you want anything to drink ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What had happened was that my grandfather had decided to reward his violin for its many years of service with a good polish .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I was telling the truth and I was dazed .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That they could have their parents back .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I realize how crazy that sounds .
tr	OTHER	Could he come now ?
tr	S_VP_.	Drinking in the taste of him tinged with beer and memories , Mary Elise clung to his broad shoulders and the moment .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then she said , "" Are you getting enough heat back there ?"
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would Miller come after me ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I need to know is if you believe there is a viable method to reverse the cleansing .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But instinct is different than an overactive imagination .
tr	VP_.	Urge him to tell me ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this day was not going at all how I had planned .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I even went by the courtroom this morning and watched some of the trial .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course she wanted details .
tr	S_VP_.	Wasn 't like it was resisting arrest , after all .
tr	S_VP_.	Dazzling paper lanterns with distinct , bright colors hanged brilliantly along the arcade .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Before he 'd pounced on her like an untried horny teenager .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As his mind began to awake he remembered Jon punching him earlier .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he had to focus on keeping them above water .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What sort of image is that ?
tr	VP_.	Just relax and enjoy yourself .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The day the curse hit and destroyed him .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Something she didn 't want to name .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What else could possibly have gone wrong in a few short days ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 15 They travelled most of the night without incident .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Now she was making all those connections and all that money she 'd spread around work for her .
tr	NP_PP_.	All because of him .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And you know why this habitat constantly adjusts as we walk through it ?
tr	VP_.	was the latest one .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That way I can verify them for myself , before I bring in the big guns .
tr	NP_PP_.	Kind of hard to be friends with someone who mocked you al the time .
tr	VP_.	Notice the little changes in her appearance , because she likely did it for you .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where is my knife ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As the light flicked on her eyes scanned the room .
tr	S_VP_.	Waiting in this line for the past hour has probably been the longest time he has spent outside in the elements .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What it did do was react , in quite complex ways , to its environment .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Mo met Kiera 's eyes and they shared a look as if Mo finally realized Kiera was attractive .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't she call ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But they aren 't here .
tr	OTHER	Because those are our choices .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What you call it in Sociology ?
tr	VP_.	"Let "" s start with this legend of a dwarf turning up , nearly dead , weeks after the battle , babbling about treasure ."
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is it about her ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All the while I thought you got only your father 's genius mind .
tr	NP_VP_.	Again with the gut punch .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was that reason enough to keep him around ?
tr	S_VP_.	Cleaning her apartment was quite the reveal .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did that prove ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He was somber when he answered .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Upon return from our time with the Snake of Orpheus she should read for me again .
tr	OTHER	Throwing sexual taunts his way .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he do it ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And probably more combinations with other numbers .
tr	NP_PP_.	Said Julie with a smile .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For what you did back there .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like everything else seemed to be these days .
tr	OTHER	Completely and utterly screwed .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Once in a while it felt like a prison .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he 's pretty scared right now .
tr	NP_VP_.	She 'd looped her arm around his waist as if she 'd been holding him tightly to her .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did such a sudden , unexpected rush of lust mean he was recovering ?
tr	OTHER	And to see my mom and my -- Nellie get along was worth all of the nervousness .
tr	NP_VP_.	It sends several confirmation requests before the transfer is finally approved .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many unbelievable things were happening to him this day .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And even he was getting a little embarrassed by his mother 's shouts and stomps .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he pays me handsomely to spend time with his mother twice a week .
tr	OTHER	At the bottom of the hill and about twenty yards to the right was the outcropping of jagged rocks they 'd climbed around to get up here .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he supposed to say that it was alright ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How were we going to explain that Hunter got injured in a cage fight ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Thus I can be sure that you are the madman , and that the words you speak are meaningless .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But we did trust his parents to have a large , unlocked liquor cabinet and plenty of space to crash .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Across the bottom of the lit screen it says , Mom calling ... I pick up .
tr	NP_VP_.	His eyes were black , deep pools of black desire .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I saw that corpse in front of me I crashed real hard , like an x86 trying to run a modern First Person Shooter .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only he was willing to admit it , whereas she preferred to ignore the obvious .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was everything okay , though ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A slow , tortuous death it was , then .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I was some spoiled little princess who needed to be married off as quickly as possible .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In broken English this beauty asked me to buy her a vero gelato , a particularly favoured frozen delight in Brazil .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who would he want to be with ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every time I move , the rocks tumble against the inside of my skull with a dull , squishy thumping .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she want to ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it longing he saw ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Arjuna seemed ready to tell him he had been part of one big practical joke .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who on earth would say no to that ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The last time he used that spot he hadn 't had to lug a body all the way .
tr	NP_PP_.	The heart of the demon .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In between times Walker foraged in the trash behind Stokes 's Grocery .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean anything ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he didn 't need to look at the scenery .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	All of sudden she feels sad and guilty once more .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	* * * I wasn 't as bad off as Phillip had been , so it only took Jo-Jo a couple of minutes to heal me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Yesterday I asked you much of life in Astoria and the Brethren in general .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the rumour of his mission would spread fast .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The room in which I sat -- the darkness that I dwelled in -- it was all exactly how I had pictured it with Ollie .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His eyes were open and he was breathing again , with a hint of a smile on his lips .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because I 'll never let myself depend on you , Gabriel .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's he got against hospitals ?
tr	S_VP_.	Leaving her was out of the question .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I wanted was to be off that highway and in some place safe and warm before dark .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the first time the old woman 's expression was hopeful , as if Colette might discover something no one else had .
tr	VP_.	Don 't let them make you less than you are .
tr	OTHER	We both knew that .
tr	NP_PP_.	A lot of things , probably .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So plans were changed .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe this Tabatha wasn 't as bad as he had made her out to be .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it exploded .
tr	OTHER	""" Goal , plan , what is your plan anyway ?"
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just to hear him gave her a sense of hope .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he anxiously crammed the stiletto into the locking mechanism he wondered if someone had arrived to rescue him .
tr	VP_.	Tell me I 'm being petty .
tr	NP_PP_.	An eternity for me .
tr	S_VP_.	Ignoring him wouldn 't budge that determined angle of his chin .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And yes , this place -- the people -- helped a lot .
tr	NP_VP_.	Lucien asked Avery and I marveled that even a courteous invitation from Lucien sounded like a command .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the back corner she had placed a bookshelf and comfy reading chair for her hours of literary comfort .
tr	OTHER	Well at least I hoped they seemed relaxed .
tr	S_VP_.	Separating each raised platform were dark areas of almost black sand that looked like veins against the brighter rocks above .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so I sleep .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this was what arousal was all about .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Meg thought for a moment that she saw a pale figure of a fair woman clad all in white .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you enjoy your night at the club ?
tr	S_VP_.	To work and live amongst her peers would be much more appropriate for her skills and power .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there was no time left .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he wasn 't .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's going on out there ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just like I was doing the first time we met .
tr	VP_.	Don 't waste time trying to frighten them , because you can 't frighten them .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course he had .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though getting too friendly wouldn 't do , either .
tr	NP_VP_.	The light from a dozen candles cast flickering shadows on the rocks and sand .
tr	VP_.	Rattle , rattle , rattle !
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Kellan slowly sat up on the bed , looking at me amused .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Here I am , your good neighbor .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's going on ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Despite being extremely social and easy to get along with he spent most of his time at home .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That it means changing everything in print about Fel 's Church - and that there is a lot in print - not to mention other media outlets ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least he didn 't have to worry about Randall Fitzgerald anymore .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What awful irony to be betrayed by the very people you were attempting to help .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I remembered why I was here .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What other reason would there be to destroy the report unless they 're planning an invasion of the country ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why should this year be any different ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he looked over the pamphlets he wondered how long they would stay here and whether Riley would have to make a choice .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What could be done ?
tr	NP_PP_.	All because of her .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he opened the basket and took out a bottle of champagne .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I had a call from my brother yesterday and he needs me to take my nephews for a fortnight .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What brought even less comfort was the fact that Miss Rigby had a few hidden aspects to herself that Leo hadn 't anticipated at all .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She sucked in a breath and he stilled .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's a stave ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though , he still held out hope that Devon would finally be able to reach her .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If only he could convince himself that 's all it was .
tr	OTHER	But let 's be realistic .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the little wooden trapdoor closed itself back up .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	"Because , "" Simms said very calmly , "" the ones I can predict cannot change anything ."
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It just ain 't in iron man statues anymore .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you break into my home and steal the evidence ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did I care whether this girl or her sister lived or died ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then she opened them again , and said , "" I believe I have had enough of this sort of partisan idiocy ."
tr	S_CC_S_.	A knot formed in my throat and I could feel my heart aching .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you find it by chance ?
tr	S_VP_.	Giving up sleep to pray was also his form of punishment for all of us .
tr	NP_VP_.	she said with an attitude .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How would she ever learn if she didn 't have to live within her means ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I really hoped there was some OJ in the fridge .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I open my eyes he 's back at the desk , tossing a large blade from his left hand to his right hand and back .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He ran the sword up to Edward 's neck and pulled out the string and the small gold band it held .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Meanwhile his eyes remained locked on the black , unmoving shape on the floor , like a blot in his vision blinding him to everything else .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By doing so he had the power to keep it from doing any real damage .
tr	VP_.	Chocolate and raspberry sauce .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That same afternoon the submariners were gathered for the announcement .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they 'd established a network of helicopters and jets available on most continents .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did it have something to do with Brian or his job ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she was up again , cheering for her girls because now it wasn 't just Danica , it was Chrissy and Amber and Jennifer .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As the song ended Hunter came in and stood beside the door .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it will be reassembled whole .
tr	S_VP_.	Standing by Alex in his hour of need means that I 'll be exposed to his lifestyle and this constant barrage of press .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Parker told him about how Cleo had appeared at his apartment the morning the magazine came out .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many of them were guilty as hell .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she swore , her body almost freezing with shock .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe he realized I wasn 't going to be that girl .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he was moving away from her , joining the eager young associates gathering at the table .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" A test of wills ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After a few attempts she gave up .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Three soldiers who charged us had their pants instantly combust and they dropped to the ground and rolled in any sand or dirt they could find .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she was 1,000 percent sure she was going to call him .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If being in a relationship with a workaholic was like this she was beginning to understand why that Olivia may have strayed after all .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How Grey fit into all this wasn 't clear to me yet .
tr	NP_PP_.	Something about his cows and pigs , and the calves and piglets that never came ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you saved my life .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many ways to convince myself we weren 't alone .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But seldom does thief ride home to the stable .
tr	NP_VP_.	he asked , using her real name instead of Mama , which most called her .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Kendall was going to cut her workforce a little slack .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he said a dragon prayer for her and covered her up .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What does Mr. Solomon look like with his shirt off ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Already they I seemed only a day 's easy journey from the feet of the nearest .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Every last one of them ."
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I don 't think he yet knows his own full power .
tr	NP_PP_.	An intruder on a private scene .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In moments brilliant white light enveloped the vessel .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Neither Sheba nor Gabe even noticed the song change .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I going mad , irrationally preoccupied with being identified ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only he can open it .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where on this earth would it be safe for him ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he could get in touch with Coulter , who would tell him about me .
tr	S_VP_.	Having to deal with Matt Hollis was more than enough .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He was truly awestruck by the enormity and extent of mind disorders the humanity was faced with .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he slipped the lock into place again he realized his hand was trembling .
tr	NP_VP_.	I text Luke and ask him if I can borrow his truck .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now the only means to nibble and chew was to do so , quietly , with it in her mouth .
tr	NP_VP_.	She 'd never been more offended in her life .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now it was time to wait .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he released her mouth and looked down at her as he propped himself on his elbows .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Watching the way she moved in her dress .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she left .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it looked like because of her power play I now had an emotionally distraught woman to deal with .
tr	OTHER	Nor was there a likelihood of encountering the law this far out in the boonies .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That you were going into that arena for people 's amusement ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where were Mother and Father ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she resent a universal pattern ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I drew in a breath , clutched my knife tighter , and slipped into the office , making sure to close the door behind me .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe Harvey would call while he had some time alone .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She pulled Nika into her lap , making sure her eyes were covered and her IV stayed safely in place .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She packed some books and notebooks and all of the drawings she had done during the past year .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Darrell works for Elliot .
tr	S_VP_.	""" Got a pigeon today as a matter of fact saying winged wolves were sighted over Edgewater ."
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way he voiced the invitation , low and husky and intimate , caused her pulse to spike despite her concerns .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I expect the same courtesy .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now you and Ruth are making plans .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why must I always second guess these things ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And here he was crying out for friendship .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He just wished they 'd come in and do it .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	This woman really loved sweets .
tr	VP_.	Do not hide from reality .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she steps away from the bulletin board she leaves scorched marks in her wake .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time I ignored the puffiness and cleaned myself up .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had he been doing ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it 's better if he doesn 't fall for me .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What are all the Fae here for ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On the table beside them was a chunky camera with an enormous zoom lens .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she die there ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This man she recognized .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it 's a clean wound .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was wrong with my mother ?
tr	VP_.	Touched the book that now lived on my nightstand .
tr	OTHER	Because I saw you .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you 've done it .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least the staff scientists didn 't expect it .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it hadn 't worked .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you just decide now to go ahead and tell a random stranger something I didn 't want anyone else to know besides you ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At present his hopes looked more likely to be answered in her case than the general .
tr	NP_PP_.	Four hundred and five miles in eight hours .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When had she found the time ?
tr	S_VP_.	Being awake physically hurt .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At this point it raised my right had a bit and moved the fingers to indicate where some of the breaks had been .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you discuss this fully with Dr. Spence ?
tr	S_VP_.	Cassidy supplied in what she thought was a rather helpful way .
tr	OTHER	"So was I. "" Yes ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I was immediately suspicious when he dropped his arm and edged away from me .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only Oliver could make him that tense .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have the nerve to report him to the police ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he had pieced together some things .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The smile he gave her when they last saw each other .
tr	OTHER	How much he meant to Lacy ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What a fool he was .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there was the guitar .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He reached for his gun , terrified , as the car came to a sudden halt and the doors flew open .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe you can do that in France .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a few places he could see some faded blue or ochre .
tr	VP_.	Concluded that they would have installed two cameras .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because she 'd saved us all from Salina 's twisted revenge scheme , and I 'd turned my back on her like a fool .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who did this to you ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it had been Eric 's hand that had squeezed her throat and made her let go of me .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I got delivered to my house in style .
tr	NP_VP_.	They flooded down her face .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Perhaps his appearance was by design she reasoned ... get the guard down and hit 'em when they 're most vulnerable .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I only undertook to bring you to the brink and I fulfilled this promise .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Until he felt like the need was consuming him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I tried reasoning with the children .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Coach 's eyes spring open , wide as baseballs , as he struggles to his feet .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What had begun as disguise had become a reality .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why add one more to the mix ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he talking about ?
tr	S_VP_.	Following my boyfriend to State was possibly the most dimwitted thing I 'd ever done .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Hopefully I had enough alcohol in my system to put me to sleep .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever he said made Brett blanch and nod .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this was what Zeus had meant .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She just couldn 't mess this up .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever purpose they had been brought in for had been fulfilled and they weren 't hanging around any longer than was needed .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he tells his wife .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only he found nothing .
tr	OTHER	Will you never learn ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean Christian had a much older brother or sister , perhaps ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did my aged sire dislike him so much ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In actuality it has been so long since one worked for the ITS that all we really have is legend .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she had talked him into hanging out for the afternoon and staying for dinner .
tr	S_VP_.	Tawny reached for Larissa and Larissa buried her head in my chest and clung to me .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What happened to her that could make her turn out this way ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Preface Michael David Kade can read minds and move with lightning speed thanks to a conversion he went through last fall .
tr	NP_PP_.	Interview people in Millbury ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 5 I didn 't roll out of bed until noon .
tr	S_VP_.	Being together with people you know is fun .
tr	NP_VP_.	She wasn 't even sure she could do it .
tr	S_VP_.	Having his help was more useful to her than she initially imagined .
tr	NP_VP_.	I would walk to China if Alexander were by my side .
tr	S_CC_S_.	They 're kind of expensive but I know they 're much more comfortable for babies to be in .
tr	NP_VP_.	It wobbled disconcertingly as she walked , flexing in places where there should have been no joints .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	A few moments later the victims stopped moving while the wolves continued dismembering their bodies .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it was down stairs to her secure personal chambers .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the paramedics lifted him , slid him into the waiting maw of the ambulance , and slammed the doors .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Brian was in there pouring the fifth cup of coffee Ian had seen him drink today , even though it was late afternoon .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had changed , if anything at all ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it was a defense , instead of saying the truth .
tr	NP_PP_.	The very cheek of it !
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just as I had suspected it would be .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Probably an answer to something her husband , Angus , had mentioned .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This week you really showed a gift for this work .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	No doubt he would .
tr	NP_VP_.	Sarah glanced back at him , her eyes firm , standing in what felt to be a powerful waterfall .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Thinking about it I was pretty sure that Winters had one or more of those boxy mutts in his family tree .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She was dressed almost exactly as the description in Erik the Red 's Saga said she would be .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he wrenched at them .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At this question the old woman smiled and blinked both her eyes at the chief in answer .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This morning there was a crime committed in Orlando that may relate to your situation .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I 'm going to have to feel that sense of loss again .
tr	VP_.	To face that impossible pain , for her sake .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It hadn 't felt like this the night I had been wasted and out of my mind .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is going on ?
tr	NP_PP_.	No more tears for Grant Durham .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But first I wanted to soak .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he 'd left the room everyone was silent .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he was gone , ducking back into the night .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had he picked out ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	A second later his hands are pressed against my cheeks .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I heard a click and the boat lit up .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Josh was glaring at me and I quickly ducked my head and broke eye contact .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He finally called his friend , Bill , and asked to meet in an hour at a local restaurant .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he cannot make this knowledge real to himself .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Him telling me this only made my heart beat faster , of course .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would Daniel think of her when he found out the truth ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	They knew what he was capable of and they wouldn 't risk it .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would I tell them ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Except I didn 't want him to eat his heart out .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where was the manifest ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After a long time I risked a look at him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For years he hoped of a possible chance to go back in time and do it all over again .
tr	OTHER	The roof dripped , the floor was sagging , and there appeared to be moss growing on the outer rock of the fireplace .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Next week there it stood in the Brazilian lab .
tr	NP_VP_.	They found twenty five survivors in all and welcomed them into the store .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was Leif here ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he showed me Blue , the largest dog they had .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I 'd gotten in the elevator and left them in the lobby so they could enjoy some time alone together .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that 's where the game ended .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The griping returned to her belly and heeding its call she crossed the room and opened her cabinet .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As they milled about he put down the bow and barked .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What happened between us last week was a mistake .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time her hair did brush against my chest .
tr	NP_VP_.	Riesling let her pull it from his hands .
tr	NP_VP_.	A girl 's voice cuts through the air .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment she thought she was lying beside Sal before realizing with a start that it was Thunder .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he turned into a bright face quickly when he handed Alvin a big purple plant with a yellow stripes .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I mention that I am bad with directions ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That each atom has ended up making up the substance of the chair is like seeing the chair as a hologram .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this was where he 'd decided to get drunk .
tr	NP_PP_.	A lengthening of a shadow ?
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting at the top of his multimillion-dollar building , strutting down the street to his company , living his life like he could care less about Delilah .
tr	OTHER	Just then a woman I recognize vaguely from the staff of the Portland Daily shoulders up to Fred .
tr	VP_.	Taking a risk , but not putting themselves in direct danger .
tr	NP_PP_.	A fatal mistake in most cases .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I suddenly realized how hungry I was .
tr	OTHER	Or was it merely another case of someone she thought she could depend on leaving her ?
tr	VP_.	Leaving me whistling a tune to myself as I finish up .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	In order to hear each other we kept our faces close .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he was in a different world , where he had to do everything on his own .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Emily immediately pushed against them and her head pounded with pressure as she forced them away .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he winked .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the sea wasn 't done with me yet .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Certainly she 'd have recalled seeing a current photo of the good-looking man standing before her .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why do you think the seraphim choose the unencumbered to be Marks ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But at least I die in song .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Staring at his reflection he saw his blue eyes staring back at him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The sea had never hurt him before and for some reason he couldn 't glide through it like he used to .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What do you have ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he paused it at the cavern , enlarged the picture and fiddled with the contrast .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell had he just done ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	That must have been the name of the horse he was interested in .
tr	NP_VP_.	Two girls danced together , one of them holding her arm out to take the photo .
tr	VP_.	Thank goodness it 's a par 3 so the agony will be over all the sooner .
tr	OTHER	""" Not up to me ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Giving a tug on his hand she forced him to a halt .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The best one she 'd ever have .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How would they know they could decorate the yard without being caught ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Balthazar really wouldn 't lie to me about anything important , even when that truth was difficult for me to hear .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do you figure that ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Only last weekend he 'd changed the oil in her car while she sewed a couple of loose buttons on his shirts .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he mean he 'd shut her up with a kiss ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they returned to their hushed conversations .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The first time I stayed home alone I was 9 years old and I couldn 't calm down the entire time .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon her body would be growing round and heavy .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I wouldn 't have felt the pain that followed as consciousness reared its pitiless head .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But my sensible side speaks up this time .
tr	VP_.	Odd that she should have that memory now .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But they were practically forming a line in front of Zach .
tr	S_VP_.	' See if you can take him round the field , ' said Sally .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once we were settled inside the car she began to speak in a tone far too casual to be anything other than a ruse .
tr	OTHER	Now be on your way !
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Abbi bit her lower lip as my cock touched her clit .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she dropped them back to her sides .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Bracing herself for the inevitable attack Shay was caught off guard when he slowly knelt beside her and touched her cheek with a gentle hand .
tr	OTHER	"Moody Serenity suggested , "" Allow me to attack whilst the rest of you remain hidden ."
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As they stood before the shelves of paint samples Carol picked out a bright pink , light pink and an apple green .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe she 'd gone to his house .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then you probably run out the back door .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he slid the empty pouch into one of his pockets .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have some mental problem ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But somehow the thought of Vela being there one day made his heart swell again .
tr	VP_.	Let her make the first move .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And somehow she 'd fallen into this privileged group .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The sheets were encased in plastic page protectors and they related to the specific items found directly below .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At Carver Store we returned the booty -- and stocked up on jerky and sunflower seeds from the payoff .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it should have felt nice walking through that massive atrium and back into the sight of her former glory .
tr	VP_.	Thank you , for the friendship you gave me .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Yes , she knew she should stop , that she should be pushing him away and telling him it could never happen .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he asked none of them .
tr	VP_.	Running for my life .
tr	NP_PP_.	Plants by the windows .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he saw made him come to a sudden halt .
tr	OTHER	Do you hear me ?
tr	OTHER	Would he have been able to keep Cody safe ?
tr	OTHER	And what if some of the vampires come back ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever he was doing to her shoulder was taking her breath away .
tr	VP_.	Let her have her delusions .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But maybe they were wrong .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All night he had wondered how she taken the news of her brother 's death .
tr	S_VP_.	Now having Colorado in the alliance made some sense .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the two wolves had entered the colony as well .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I directed the conversation to my friend , mostly because I was furious that Jenny had the audacity to continue lying to me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Each Memorial Day we visited their graves and placed flowers by their headstones .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was it about a man that made him notice a woman who was prickly as a wet cat ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every time my mother stares into the refrigerator like a prisoner of war about to be shot , it 's time to go back to Weight Watchers .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she paused , cocked her head to one side , and listened .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why don 't you grab it , carefully , and head over to the Masons ' with Colt ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I 've never questioned him like this before .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Jim hesitantly opened her passenger door and sat down .
tr	S_VP_.	Making the most of Jake 's fix-it ideas was definitely the order of the day .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then a tapping noise snapped his eyes open .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I don 't agree with the things he does so he doesn 't tell me much .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Without another word she turned and walked out of the room .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Frank frowned , how she knew that he had thought it was a super coffee puzzled him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I motion with my head to the small space we 're in and the torture tub .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She also lost her patience while attempting to make him some complicated souffle that went tremendously badly however her foul-mouthed tirade after it collapsed was immensely entertaining .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Oh , but the way he 'd made her feel as they 'd danced slowly together !
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it was her turn to stiffen .
tr	S_VP_.	Acting like I was still a human child meant death .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How dare he sneak into her home , blatantly stare at her as if she were a common tart and then treat her with such aloof amusement ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The first time you ignored me was my first broken heart .
tr	NP_PP_.	Abandoned Erebus for the lightning planet .
tr	NP_VP_.	I wet a towel in the sink , squeezed the water from it and went to sit on the sofa , the cloth over my eyes .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she surprised him by turning to him and offering the sweetest smile he 'd ever seen .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When would I be able to see your face ?
tr	S_VP_.	Being petulant just wasn 't convenient at this age .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now you have nothing holding you to New York .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was there I saw Dimitri coming through the revolving door just as the last dim watercolor bled from the sky .
tr	NP_PP_.	Three in the morning .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I exclaimed , feeling a true emotion finally break through the haze of depression I had been in .
tr	NP_VP_.	His friends had made it -- hopefully all of them .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe we 'll have to find another place for you .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But her heart wanted a clear sign that her love was reciprocated .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It probably didn 't matter .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I heard it .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the Fates transformed them into those things .
tr	OTHER	A world where the Mafia didn 't exist .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	""" Mom "" I croaked ."
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she allowed to have her boyfriend at work ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It did not occur to me you would have sex with me and get up and leave .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His vision was blurred for a moment and blood was gushing from his nose .
tr	VP_.	Jumping from halfway up the grand stairs , into Scott 's waiting arms , giggling as he yelled at me .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Who she 'd been didn 't matter as much as who she became from this point forward .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I don 't .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I lie when I told them I was the one they had been waiting for ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I definitely didn 't want to converse with Gabriel as if they were mute or like living pieces of furniture .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where can we stay ?
tr	S_VP_.	Leaving Woods to look after Blaire was dangerous .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As it turned out Jock might be compared with Uncle Samuel in a need for rescue , in this case while in command of a motor vehicle .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just thought your tattoo was kind of cool and it gave me this great idea .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just looked at the student council president after they were gone .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he took off his glove and gripped it in his still sweaty , slightly red palm .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she look as dead as she felt ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they waited for the good doctor to continue .
tr	NP_VP_.	A very tall building stood to the west of the town , looking like large clock tower .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I knew that when the time came to just have each other , we would be alright .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why don 't you just ride with me ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When they hook up with a guy they need him to stay around for a while .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	"But then he said , "" That 's stupid ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For some unknown reason her soul won 't leave her body .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would he give her up if he liked her ?
tr	VP_.	Do not hesitate to use it in case of an emergency .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She still wore a small bandage but there was no sign of any other physical problems resulting from the blow to her head .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he closed his eyes .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he have that kind of cash lying around ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Tim took this as the sign of pride in him it was meant to convey .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where in the Hell had that come from ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Boromir had come leaping through the trees .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she really want to quit her first job after a couple of months ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For that is indeed the meaning of their name in our tongue .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	"* * * "" I live in a studio and my bathroom is just a five-step walk from my bed ."
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How long before your fortress crumbles from within ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Daemon pointed at the Healer , then at the adults he assumed were Sylvia 's hosts .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He had a duffel bag draped over one shoulder and teeth white enough to blind .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she repeated the process using the salt .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he possibly go with Pia to safety and leave the boy to die ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he liked it .
tr	NP_VP_.	I am aware that it is not done .
tr	NP_VP_.	He did try to blame me , though .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had he allowed it ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was Jane real y surprised , or just faking it ?
tr	VP_.	Bring back the guy who was so into the game .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it went against the grain , damned if it didn 't .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was happening here ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The Shadows of Time series began one night when she was fifteen .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she glances at Eden and touches his chin .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then we go around systematically covering all the windows as swiftly as we can .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They apparently hit it off .
tr	NP_VP_.	You will live in this manor .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He moved his fingers and she jerked against his hand .
tr	S_VP_.	Trying on bras reminded Kylie of the Goldilocks fairy tale .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way he said my name made a shiver roll across my back .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now the feeling of impending doom was growing .
tr	S_VP_.	Putting the groceries away in the duplex cabinets made me feel that I really lived there .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was the matter with him ?
tr	VP_.	Do not try to be heroes .
tr	S_VP_.	Listening to his voice had become her favorite pastime while in the palace .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	First she 'd anticipated .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they 'd be gone back to their lives and she to hers .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He had no weapons and the layout of the Citadel 's interior was not common knowledge .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I could see the lights of Berlin and I was in awe how beautiful it was .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe she 's just waiting for us to say it .
tr	OTHER	Could she have forgotten that detail ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I barely got to talk to him at the ball .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On the gossip sites there 's only the one supermodel mention , that they know of anyway .
tr	NP_VP_.	The bridge swayed again , as though it were a horse trying to buck them off .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then a cleanliness drive was started by him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I couldn 't tell him I wanted it warmer .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One day he didn 't come home .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he didn 't find was ID .
tr	OTHER	Wasn 't she waiting around for Sean 's call with her hand poised on the answer button of her phone ?
tr	OTHER	Nineteen million five hundred seventy five thousand dollars ?
tr	VP_.	Wouldn 't trust it to be the same so easy as yesterday .
tr	NP_VP_.	It wrestled back , pulling her with greater vigor , and tightening its grip on her foot .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	* * Upon reaching the bloodied battleground , the first thing I noticed was the rank of the Brute .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if he 'd somehow forgotten how to ride a bike .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His dad may have had several hard times while Derek was growing up but he was essential to Derek 's company now .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By then they 'd have a fix and a centripetal whip to a first-rate , habitable system .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly she felt giddy , joyful , almost stoned .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	If anything he had performed better than anyone had given him credit for .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you learn anything from her ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What happens to me when it 's time to be born again ?
tr	S_VP_.	Freeing you was an incredible feat .
tr	NP_PP_.	Alice Franklin in particular .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I still sometimes retrieve that acceptance letter and marvel that someone wanted to publish me .
tr	OTHER	The minute they did , I saw a furry paw and then felt the gentle thump of it against my cheek .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before I could say anything smart he 'd gone .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then Mr. Mercer just shook his head and took a sip of coffee from an ALOHA FROM HAWAII !
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Grigori beamed at the monstrous home he had created .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And my sister was so not my sister anymore .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He squeezed her shoulder in encouragement and she gave him a brave smile , urging the servant to lead on , lest they be late .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then a quick run up the circular steps to an even smaller platform .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But right now my enemy was Katarina .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she felt confident that they 'd figure it all out .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he would be left to the fish .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What mattered was saying the right thing to this sad , wonderful woman .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of what might happen if she let him lead her there .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I got out of that pretty quickly .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Tonight he was wearing a pair of faded blue jeans and a black T-shirt that showed off his seriously cut muscles .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Not the kind of private time he was hoping for .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On a muffled cry she shoved up on her pallet and clutched her amulet .
tr	VP_.	Close enough to take missing out of the equation .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For two hours they passed through a labyrinth that seemed never-ending .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I watched as an expression of deep desire slowly came into them .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" None of them ."
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the snorting horses turned suddenly , almost breaking the wagon tongue .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The patterns linked up in her mind and she saw how it could be done .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By definition if you 're in the armed services you won 't be around children .
tr	OTHER	And what is a prosperous merchant from Jerusalem doing in Ostia ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What you are is a gift to the entire world .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Except digging out the burrows .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a flash she picked up the pot of steaming soup , whirled around and threw it at him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I tell him that , too .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then it 's over .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I should give him the benefit of the doubt .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He really shouldn 't be out here at all , but had refused to listen when she 'd suggested going by herself .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	No doubt they were seeing Ellie 's body .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I felt anxious and scared .
tr	OTHER	Up from the ball sprang small keys , also made of brass , which had the letters of the alphabet printed on them .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a panicked moment I contemplated asking Paul to take me home .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I was paying this cop 's salary with my tax dollars .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he took it to the copier he saw in the administrative assistant area .
tr	VP_.	"Logging off mistress , "" and with that the terminal blanked ."
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least he had to try .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She wasn 't actually sure she would have been able to get him to leave his brother otherwise .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can a guy in his condition be of any use ... to the human race ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Kaitlyn know who Harrington really was ?
tr	S_VP_.	To make matters worse , what I could see of her face seemed blurry .
tr	NP_PP_.	The very objective of their campaign .
tr	VP_.	Might be a good time to walk around without attracting too much attention .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was going on ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where did it fit in ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As I sat next to her I could hear her teeth chattering .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Over the years he had come to enjoy his failure .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It is unacceptable to accede to their wishes in any way or else it will weaken our position .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he wasn 't about to open the heavy plank door to the side yard , which was how he 'd gotten in .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would his hands feel like on her flesh ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	She did take every opportunity to employ her intellect with Charlie and he 'd finally had enough one night .
tr	VP_.	Drive a car pool ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I finally ask after I swallow the bite and sit down at the table .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For countless minutes longer they stood still and watched .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she would have lost the biggest chance she 'd ever had .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Behind her stood Chain with his arms folded , glaring at her .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whether Baxter decided to come out of the closet was up to Baxter .
tr	NP_PP_.	A lick of a bright pink lollipop .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	With peace comes expansion , and with expansion comes the need for us to find new worlds .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After lunch they went to the pond at the park and fed the ducks .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this was what it was like to be mortal .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he leads me out into the open bar area that has tables and chairs on one side and a few pool tables on the other .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Some nights I was so frustrated over my situation I just wanted to scream .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he accusing me of something ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Yet the whole scheme is orchestrated to produce these very results : sin and punishment , deprivation and violence .
tr	VP_.	Holds it under my nose .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you feel energy coming from me ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The only way we 've found to successfully destroy them .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What matters is Chewy 's reaching out to the world to make it a better place .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What might Crawley say next ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he lifted the tip of the rapier and thrust upward .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What will our efforts fix ?
tr	OTHER	Then the side door opened and the crowd went still .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course she thought that .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'll have to use ASCII .
tr	VP_.	Thrilled that he 'd found someone .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did she look gleeful at the prospect ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Not the idea of me carrying his baby if I 'm pregnant .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the neighborhood looked different after dark .
tr	NP_VP_.	We have experience in these situations .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Unless Carey herself had prevented him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I looked over at him and spoke .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He kissed her again and again and again , his hands shifting , tormenting , seducing until Alexandra lost all control .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe she should tell Roxy what was going on .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So her day was very typical .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because she 's out with Richard doesn 't mean that you 've lost your chance forever .
tr	NP_PP_.	A look of pain , yes , but also of forgiveness and longing .
tr	NP_VP_.	Research has shown there to be more similarities between the two languages than can be attributed to mere chance .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So food , water , shelter , enough work to keep them busy ... was she forgetting something ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Anything other than the truth .
tr	OTHER	I saw the razor in his hand and all I could think about was him touching me again .
tr	NP_VP_.	Stars exploded behind her eyelids .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he would leave the subject now .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe we should talk about how I told Finn to hold him back and how you helped with that ?
tr	VP_.	asked Nick , irritated .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon the focus of the attack shifts from the front of the castle to confront all of the other sides that are now being attacked .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although , it was nice to not have Lenny put all his hatred towards me for once .
tr	NP_VP_.	I went at it over and over , until he was groaning and in no shape to get back up .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Having experienced the same accelerated maturity they were bulky , although nothing on their sire .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did you save me ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like she doesn 't want to look me in the eye .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As Minister of Securities I promise each and every one of you that this is the last day that chaos will reign in this fine country .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How many people saw me passed out at the doorway last night ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she share nothing personal with anyone ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How often did he have to feed ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Look , Cami , just come out with me .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the diva was adamant .
tr	NP_PP_.	No one talks of colored threads , or weaves .
tr	S_VP_.	Like the one that the Order recently discovered had been kept in hibernation deep within the rock of the Bohemian mountains for probably centuries .
tr	OTHER	If only she could switch it off for a while and give herself a rest .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did it get so big ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even when Baron Samael loosed his deadly spell they sat frozen , unable to even consider taking flight .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were they supposed to be paying attention to the decompression ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What have I done ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As they moved carefully across the walkway they noticed that small chinks of light came in through the bomb doors far below .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Made her soar higher and faster than she had ever been before .
tr	NP_VP_.	Malcolm Forbes , an American millionaire , bought twelve of the fifty-four known to have existed .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And quickly he did !
tr	OTHER	So why was Edward 's life being thrust at me ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was I to tell him that his dead son forgave him ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you give her a new coffee ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then Westfield was there , directly before her .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I record his height and take long deep sniffs of the air he moves through to record his scent .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I watched the sun rise on the wrong edge of the world .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If anyone found she 'd been meeting a man .
tr	VP_.	Forced himself to turn .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then he said , "" Sir , if I might respectfully suggest it , I think we 'd be better served to push them farther out ."
tr	NP_PP_.	Full of the past .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He also learned that gargoyles , like vampires , had subservient creatures they ruled .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes I hated how well she knew me .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Prior to the end of the rains the underground earth remained soft as it soaked up every drop of water .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then one evening after watching the news he turned the TV off !
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did it matter anymore ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	His brown eyes , framed in thick lashes , were open and honest and his hair was just the right length and thickness .
tr	NP_VP_.	She had a terrible hairstyle .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Some of them I 'd known since kindergarten .
tr	NP_PP_.	Good Lord in heaven !
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Overwhelmed by the gift I let the words on my mind slip out .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the world is out there , Ruby , even if you haven 't seen it .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although it didn 't originally start out like that .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she had done it in the hope that she would find she could control it after all .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that hot feeling was there , stealing through my veins .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"If it 's chicken ... "" Elliot shuddered ."
tr	S_CC_S_.	Chapter Three The morning wasn 't going exactly as Ilona had hoped but she supposed she 'd just have to get on with it .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Hold the button down for no more than ten seconds or it may overheat .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	His lips immediately fell to my right breast as his fingers played with my left one .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Black dots swam before my eyes and I swayed a little on my feet .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he mean for her to move his armor out of the way ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was stunning .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Christine started the conversation by thanking him for everything he had done for her the previous Friday night .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Lauren sat down on the bed and the cat jumped beside her and snuggled onto her pillow .
tr	NP_PP_.	Pride in what he 'd done .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing her cry made Clay wish he could tell her everything would be okay .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't I just offer him a ride ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	what do I do now ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	How he wished he had an older brother to confide in , and share his nightmare with .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon the sword would meet the enemy .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Before I could totally relax the phone rang again .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Taking Maria by the hand he ceremoniously walked up to the head table and expressed appreciation to Billy for hosting the event .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way he wanted it to be .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once the songs began to move in the direction of protest music their progress was rapid and unstoppable .
tr	VP_.	Watch a good movie and take your mind off of things for awhile .
tr	NP_PP_.	Stop thinking about that !
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's a tandem ?
tr	VP_.	See what 's inside .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If it isn 't jumping off something it 's dropping into a hole in the ground or flinging themselves down a hillside .
tr	NP_PP_.	The shape of her head .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The light outside was thinning as if a dark mixture , from an unseen hand , was being steadily poured in to it .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did everyone believe the old man and I were lovers ?
tr	S_VP_.	Taking him out would have been easy .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was this all connected somehow ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She choked on the champagne and had to take two gulps .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What happened was Ada lost her temper again , and punished Caitlin , even though I told her many times not to do so .
tr	NP_VP_.	Marian peeked out the door just as thunder rent the air and lightning lit the sky , illuminating the woman who stood on the threshold .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But soothing her couldn 't undo the past .
tr	VP_.	Hear her gasp again .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Since you have communications experience you will handle the wireless .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the rebel have a death wish ?
tr	S_VP_.	Trying to not let his fear show .
tr	NP_VP_.	It 's one thing for us to know how you 're scoring so well .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could such pure beauty be corrupted ?
tr	NP_PP_.	A shrug of those wide shoulders .
tr	OTHER	Gettin ' too old .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	During training one out of four times she would win the fight .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did she keep thinking about things that were no longer a part of her life ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that 's what shook everyone up .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were they armed , he wondered ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	After they were finish she sat across from him and took out her compact .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What were those tyrant monsters thinking by unleashing such a disaster upon us ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I saw him again when I was scouting the Lombard building .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she recalled her own elation and comfort felt in The One 's presence .
tr	NP_PP_.	The walls of Constantinople .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you corner him ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a minute the two vehicles did a sort of grinding paso doble , circling wheel to wheel , tires smoking .
tr	VP_.	Lock that shit up .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course he was .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I realized his meaning was much more mundane .
tr	NP_PP_.	The tip of her nose .
tr	NP_VP_.	She was the only thing besides music that made him feel the same way .
tr	S_VP_.	' Get this down you , ' said a woman from the street , leaning over him in her apron .
tr	NP_PP_.	One of King Gerald 's master carpenters .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What can I say ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Only when he walks out the door can I breathe freely again .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After another half hour they had all five bodies , but no sign of buried treasure .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	About the Author Ryan Gladney lives in Minneapolis , Minnesota , with his wife and son .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	"Finally he said , "" Not really ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	During the cab ride Zena clung to me like a frightened child .
tr	S_VP_.	At least being there my mind and my body were my own and were not being controlled by hormones .
tr	S_VP_.	Telling the truth would leave me worse off than having to pay the ticket .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Cautiously they began to climb down the rusted stairs .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he feel as if he was taking over where Manson had left off ?
tr	S_VP_.	Crossing a Buchanan was tantamount to tangling with a lion .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you just see how disappointed I was , my whole family , to find out that my father 's not coming home this summer ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She wouldn 't tell him she 'd already been coerced into lunch .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Unable to move for fear of upsetting the direction this fantasy was beginning to go .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell did that mean ?
tr	S_VP_.	Stopping to listen they exchanged wary looks .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she wasn 't home .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I dance when I had a big round belly ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I do something that upset him and not realize it ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because it was the first time with this promise .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After a minute they came over to me and handed me a cashier 's check .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was too late .
tr	VP_.	Spend one day and see what you think .
tr	S_VP_.	Surrounding her with warmth when she was so cold .
tr	OTHER	Are they big enough and numerous enough to give a good show .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I vaguely recognize them from his parties .
tr	VP_.	Listen a little more please before you decide .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I called her an old woman !
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she wandered over to the end of the room where shelves of potion bottles and jars lined the walls , reminding her of home .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One of these days they will figure out what has really been happening all along .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So my two are going with me .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she know what happened at the library ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If not I like the way that sounds .
tr	NP_VP_.	I couldn 't run into Patch .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The three boys sat around the table and the game began .
tr	S_VP_.	Starting on the cut sounds great .
tr	OTHER	Partly because that is when the Jackals sleep .
tr	NP_PP_.	More like a lifetime .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I wasn 't going to have to go sit and wait on Mommy up in Heaven ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I want more but James won 't let me .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did you know ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Since the moment I saw your face , your beautiful young face on that hot dry day .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I narrow my eyes at him , wishing I had the power to shoot darts out of them instead of having my useless power .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now I needed it more .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	To have all the money and time and powers he could dream of ?
tr	VP_.	Imagine what a scoundrel could get away with no one around to hear her scream !
tr	OTHER	The minute his foot hit the ground , a net came up off the ground , palms and leaves raining off of it .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they all talk this way here ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Inside the little crib there was indeed another doll , only its head visible above tiny coverlets .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Two nights ago the gesture would have felt intimate .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why is he telling me all this ?
tr	VP_.	said Kayla as she came back to the table and sat down next to Haven .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The instructor nodded and I rolled my eyes .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe he 'd just realized what he was doing to Jackie , tying her to a man with no soul .
tr	NP_PP_.	Fear of the mammoth black dragon that landed in the middle of their camp .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I gulp in a huge mouthful of air .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And there was his daughter , his little girl , to consider .
tr	S_VP_.	Calling her parents proved harder than she thought .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did he do that ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Christopher almost wanted to laugh .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Once he 's done that we 're going to run .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every time she saw J.J. now she would wonder if he was thinking about it .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last month the kids and I hosted their aunt and little cousin Erma at our house .
tr	NP_PP_.	Ten thousand square feet on ten acres .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he was not alone .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then you must rise above your struggle .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the paramedics were there , hurrying down the dock , carrying their tackle boxes of medical equipment .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If we attack now we lose .
tr	OTHER	Just remember what we went over .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So a bottle would make short work of him .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	this time the calm voice was filled with terror .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He truly hoped that it wouldn 't all go wrong , as he really wanted her to see a Wood henge at night .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Yet here they were , pinned to the walls of a poor market seller in melting heat .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	You just need to make sure you don 't waste your mortal time worrying about your immortal future .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I jumbled logs from previous testing and set the machine to send random entries to the mainframe .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Inevitably he shut off the voices .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The one you want to preserve above all else .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	"Randy and Joshua exchanged glances then Randy answered , "" They went through the drawers and closets ."
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would have happened if she 'd been home ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As quick as you can .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even before the tragedy she 'd tiptoed around him .
tr	S_VP_.	Craving the feeling of her sister 's presence was an understatement .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would someone send it ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But first I want to thank Tara .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When Kae had reappeared his face instantly reddened , the air literally being squeezed out of him .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time his voice mail was full .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Why a mortal would willingly interact with an undead was something she couldn 't comprehend .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How the hell could I make him pay attention ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she nods slowly , before leaving to walk silently up the hill back to the party .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least his lady boss was not complaining too loudly .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I didn 't appear to them .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Even nauseous , it wasn 't lost on me my husband was hot .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he 'd stormed out , muttering that things would be different if he was in charge .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	* * * Ted smiled as he watched Dreamer help Baby Julian unwrap his last present .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Cole relieved her agitation by putting their relationship back on terms she was comfortable with .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever thought crime didn 't pay had obviously never tried to make a living on the wrong side of the law .
tr	VP_.	Don 't be so suspicious on Christmas .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they hung up .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She almost expected him to grab her from behind .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he planning on killing one of us and then burying the body ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How many had thought they were about to have her just before their lives ended ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Since I wasn 't the most popular person I knew it could be one of three people .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the first time he thought of forgetting his promise to Marcus and getting out while he still could .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Figured she 'd pay more attention to that than she did to me trying to talk to her before .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he 'd spotted long skid marks on the gravel road , marking where a car had accelerated wildly away from the front of her house .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I shake my head and sit up , rubbing the back of my hand across my face , making my makeup worse I 'm sure .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had she said that ?
tr	VP_.	Being careful not to scare me away .
tr	NP_PP_.	The type of Marine that went to war .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I left , feeling her eyes on my back the whole time .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What hot-blooded woman could deny it ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many questions , and no answers .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she be so selfish ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they got a good laugh at her expense .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What made them think this was for me ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I guess I 'm doing something right .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they know that Mistborn found their homes a convenient highway , a place where they could move without being bothered by guards or thieves ?
tr	OTHER	So nice to be appreciated occasionally .
tr	S_VP_.	Dealing with the police force isn 't something I have much experience with .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She briefly contemplated going back to get her things but couldn 't face it .
tr	OTHER	Maybe even an exclusive couple .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It 's hard to ignore the cries of the young but there 's nothing we can do without giving our position away .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And relief flickered in his face , so I knew I was right .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why do I believe this ?
tr	VP_.	Didn 't used to be .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he hadn 't shoved his claws into Sean 's side .
tr	NP_VP_.	He stripped her of everything .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he do this thing ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Over the years she had mastered the art of ignoring the pain in her muscles , the growling in her stomach .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But this Neal hadn 't given up on her yet .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In no time I was standing outside the hole , my breath coming in ragged gasps .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was the King involved in all of that ?
tr	S_VP_.	Being a single pregnant nineteen year old with no family was bad though .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although how he 'd make her understand the need to destroy her father , or her family in lieu of Everett , escaped him at the moment .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he have missed such overwhelming ambition ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps she would somehow alert Cliff that she was free , ruining any chance Jason might have .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she wondered when her next adventure would land her in an interesting case or dilemma .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Lillian frantically tried to get his attention but he pretended not to see her .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I really wanted Zane to feel comfortable discussing Noah .
tr	OTHER	Just another temporary refuge .
tr	VP_.	Tell them all that they want to hear while you get what you want .
tr	OTHER	And I never knew I could enjoy feeling like a fumbling idiot so much .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What makes a person special ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With a deep breath she turned to me , leaning against the kitchen counter .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was more , he wondered , were the Templars hunting for other artefacts ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where were you when your friends from Hancock went up to Canada to inquire into Cronin 's time in the military ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would Graham think if he knew he was standing next to Tabitha 's murderer ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because he dared to hope maybe one day his step brothers would grow up just a little ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In his dream he was visiting a Mexican village .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It was late October and nobody wore thin cotton during this season .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	However as he approached I could see mounds of dandruff sprinkled over his shoulders , back and chest .
tr	VP_.	Say hello before you leave .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who could have done such a thing ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it snarled from a mouth full of razor-sharp yellow teeth .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she looked back down at her shoulder .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet he loved this thing .
tr	NP_PP_.	A good place for a secret society .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He kissed and nibbled his way down her neck and her tremors grew .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I doomed to spend the rest of my life constantly hunted and trying to save the dying around me ?
tr	S_VP_.	Staring at it made my stomach turn .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much could happen to him , to me ... to us .
tr	NP_VP_.	He had no right to tell anyone else what to do .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We also went into the forest , where she would read or sew .
tr	OTHER	Or desperate to feel something excitingly positive after being dumped by Brendan .
tr	OTHER	Have you seen a lady in red dress ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least he 'd gotten in some good punches before it was taken away from him .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps Alana 's law was the correct path .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What kind of man can 't pick up a bag of sweets ?
tr	S_VP_.	Having me in the area was enough to force the other side into retreat .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was the big difference between a Sheer and a shadow ?
tr	NP_VP_.	All of we here to keep the secrets of the few !
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why were so many people desperate for a piece of this place and that other club , Possession ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Anton was attracted to me .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now there was a dead body , a trail .
tr	S_VP_.	Pressed against the back of the case was a folded piece of paper .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As her lips received his the relief surpassed his first successful transatlantic landing .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Sonia rounded up Jay , Jed and Jake from down the road .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then we print those few pages out and give them to the representatives .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then he continued , "" Club him with a baseball bat or ram a stick in his scars if that 's all you have ."
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Since I 'm so small the doctor doesn 't think I 'll make it to the full forty weeks .
tr	VP_.	Remember what that guy at the desk told us .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I ever have thought I should escape from the King ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Renée tried to stop me but with great strength I smashed the brush against one of the glass slippers .
tr	VP_.	Solve the immediate risk first .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would her life have been like if she 'd had the chance to raise her daughter with her father ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did Enrique know about her ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then a dozen more serfs .
tr	NP_PP_.	The rise of another .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe she 'd misheard him .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And you didn 't like it much as I remember .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment he listened .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why wasn 't she following procedure ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I 'll make a quick trip to Vegas to check out the lamp .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I shook it off .
tr	OTHER	If it were a virginal rejection of the male .
tr	VP_.	Sent me spinning into a fiery rage .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I kicked o my pants .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I had lied , just a little .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A little more than a year would give her and Jason ample time to discover if a marriage between them was viable .
tr	NP_PP_.	A Frisbee for a discus .
tr	S_VP_.	Separated from that was another small field where crops grew .
tr	S_VP_.	Still lacking urgency everyone got to chatting again .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did anything matter ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Not exactly the hands-on method I 'd imagined .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When she 'd traded her life for his .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Not because she helped him work better , but because she helped him live better .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he became creative .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For what seemed like miles went by and Eli wondered where they were going .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where are you when I need you ?
tr	NP_PP_.	tight confines of the cabin .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she spoke , her voice smoky and fluid like old Scotch .
tr	NP_VP_.	"Mandy replied , "" No , thanks , Jason ."
tr	NP_PP_.	The shadow of hell .
tr	OTHER	Before her eyes , she had to watch her husband , her Blood Mate , her only true love die .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he 'd put in place Plan B .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you see the game ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last week Leo had enjoyed not worrying about his food being gone before he got a chance to even taste it .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time the words didn 't sound so casual .
tr	NP_PP_.	Dirty underwear on the floor ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because Cassidy had been wrong about one thing in that desperate lie she 'd delivered that night in the park .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Within moments he was wrapped inside a sphere of light so bright that details inside the foil became invisible to him .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it lies still , panting , heart pounding , eyes wide .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Inside the bag she discovered a large vanilla shake , a burger and fries .
tr	NP_PP_.	Much older than his father , which is how he judged the age of adults .
tr	NP_VP_.	She felt once again that she was truly becoming whole .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	That I only look like a human being ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	He body ached for sleep but her mind raced on .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now chances were that she 'd die before summer 's end .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Probably because you fell asleep , and things got spoiled .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Hank : Well you have to sing all of it .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Except she didn 't say a word .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How am I supposed to answer your questions ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was for the best , really .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I shouldn 't have admitted to being expelled .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I bit my lip and nodded and he , more gently than I had , closed the door again .
tr	S_VP_.	Crying in front of Eden at a time like this is way too embarrassing .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I spotted my family in the back of the crowd , eyes focused on me .
tr	VP_.	Aimed them at Ryder 's body .
tr	VP_.	Find out who he 's become , and destroy him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In helpless anguish she turned to face the man who held her immediate future in his hands .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Beneath his lip one saw a fang protrude .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Even when what they asked broke me into a million pieces .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he was okay .
tr	OTHER	For both of them .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So there was no remorse in her , no phantom urge to protect him as she grabbed his head and twisted his neck to the side .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The minute the brisk air hit her hot cheeks she felt the ground bob to greet her .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Before he could knock the door opened and a woman who he estimated to be about ninety smiled and stuck out her hand .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he got to his feet .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Sheppard then grasps Nick around the shoulder in a friendly conciliatory way , drawing him near like a close friend and confidante .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Maria , the old housekeeper wearing a gown fit for a courtesan with her chest nearly exposed , she was crying and shouting still .
tr	VP_.	Do yourself a big favour and get rid of her .
tr	NP_VP_.	Ella 's hand is still clamped around John 's wrist .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did this have to happen to me ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now John started quizzing them .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As I had missed some meetings they had together before the change in coordinators I felt sort of like the odd man out in the group .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was my father doing in Peggy 's Cove the month of my seventh birthday ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Out of nothing he fashioned a heavy cardigan .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had I done ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was a stupid kitten doing in the middle of the forest a million miles from anything ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	She was rattled and when that happened , the words kept flowing no matter how hard she tried to stop them .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Looking after Isabelle was a pleasure he 'd never thought he 'd have .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he drove off .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely that meant he 'd soon be bandaged up and on his way .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Closer to him she watched with a frank interest and saw that he was holding a bent metal rod in each hand .
tr	OTHER	So gentle and quiet that she almost didn 't hear it .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knew how far that reach extended into local law enforcement ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she felt it too , then , Jess noted .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did it really matter ?
tr	VP_.	Right out to the parking lot , to Jenna 's car .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if they were closer somehow than before .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He 'd told me I was his life .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Jimmy moaned and Chase looked down at the man for a split second .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had that to do with anything ?
tr	S_VP_.	Hearing the gravelly words only exacerbated the needy spasms of her internal muscles .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time we managed to put some more distance between us .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why in the world would Rigel Stuart be interested in the details of my life ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Earlier that afternoon Gage had teased her about taking advantage of Bradley .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Yet here I sat , in my room , staring at the very black screen of my phone .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes she forgot they 'd actually gotten married .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I stepped aside and she flew in .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would I be compelled to leave when this flesh feels so full of life .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it was Jared 's turn to hum .
tr	NP_PP_.	The day winding down and the weariness of walking the short distance to a beat-up couch and TV that was dying by the channel .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The bone alone is worth a fortune !
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I couldn 't stand the idea of Grant looking at me the way others had .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I suppose it makes sense .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not that Gabby was falling for it .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why should this be any different ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter Four Last night had been the ultimate in dinner disasters .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	CONNECT WITH US We would love to hear from you !
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The first few times he pressed the button nothing happened .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I used the breakup I 'd caused , cutting me off from friends I depended on because I was the aggressor .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing that was life changing .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It met up with our first one and the ones Matty and Chuck had done at nearly the exact same location .
tr	S_VP_.	Spend it on your family or on those people you know could use your help .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	After the sun has set , and before the moon has risen , thought Spider .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Over the past few years Lea had made a determined effort to find the man who could make Nicole forget Patrick .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it was the proximity to our apartment that made it so real .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who puts loose fruit in a paper bag ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it was a standoff .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I say something wrong ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She never allowed herself to believe that Colby loved her enough to work through the things that stood between them .
tr	VP_.	Go out there and find Kara .
tr	S_VP_.	Getting that guy 's hands off Jamison had felt as necessary as breathing .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now she was a prisoner in the car .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knows what would have happened had I let them continue ... possibly the Apocalypse ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he instantly turned and strode out of the tent , all the warriors following him .
tr	NP_PP_.	A perfect night for a strike .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Not the first three words you 'd usually use to describe a college football arena .
tr	S_VP_.	Keeping the grounds and surrounding beach patrolled and safe was their job , as well as that of Gabe , Gene and Spencer .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes he dreamt of shadowy figures who chased and tormented him .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why wouldn 't he want her ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For practical purposes his arms felt like short lengths of wet rope .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was going on ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the violence was inside the city , inside the castle , and already inside his quarters .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she wanted to say was all this sucked .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he had to say wouldn 't change the bottom line .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could a mother be cruel to a child as sweet and innocent as Isaac ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The leader barely managed to avoid the calamity .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I am tiptoeing around this German connection you mentioned .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But right then she was mine .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did you abandon me ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she see him ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The foyer boasted a high ceiling and the walls on each side held an ornate opening that revealed the massive rooms beyond .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she patted her daughter 's shoulder and walked away again leaving the two of them alone at the table .
tr	S_VP_.	To move up into the Z category would mean disaster .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It quickly darted through the air , completely missing all five of the men and exploding into a lamppost with a bright flash .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just feel that Billings might have been pushed into this , somehow .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Quite deliberately he walked to the mouth of the gallery and stepped out into the cavern , making no attempt to conceal himself .
tr	NP_VP_.	He stood and came up beside her , grasping her hand before she could pull away .
tr	S_VP_.	Being the eldest meant he also washed the dishes before leaving .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But at least he was human .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And one day take him shopping in that mortal shop , Mothercare World .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Only when André poked its rear with his knife did it move forward .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He 's over a hundred and he was still thick enough to think that insulting her was a good idea .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The time I brought the daisies .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As if being philosophical about it will earn you marks !
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She simply stared incapable of speech as he relieved her of the laptop .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But instead I 'm stuck at a distance , watching her as she shuts the car door and turns for the entrance of the school .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Tomorrow I have a major photo shoot with one of the top photographers in the country .
tr	S_VP_.	Having just her sister for companionship would either be very lonely or very troubling .
tr	S_VP_.	Building a nice , steady life where she was liked and respected had always been important to her .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It actually happened after the article was published .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she imagine she was seeing the beginnings of a courtship ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because that 's the most I 'd ever take with anyone .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What took place in my life for the past two weeks were still hardly believable .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Each morning she pressed a hand over her stomach and whispered a fervent prayer that her weekend of lovemaking with Steve had found fertile ground .
tr	VP_.	Remember those important people I told you about ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I mention that I was in Rome ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it released her and she was falling .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she Pulled on the sword of a fallen soldier , yanking it into her hand .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you confess you believe you 're Napoleon ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it had been a bad night for both of them .
tr	OTHER	Not normally a threat vector .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	He himself was wearing a conventional black suit with a white shirt and a green patterned tie that matched his eyes .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she heaved again , shouldering the lever and pushing with her legs .
tr	NP_PP_.	A pity in a way , though .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was there to say ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	It was a guessing game and he had lost .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every morning Rowan rose of her own accord .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He then placed his hand on my head .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	More that she worried Caleb would not see Gordon 's sneaky manipulation until it was too late .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Well I wasn 't going back now .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean it was losing its effectiveness , or that the end was near and nothing could stop it ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she be such a fool ?
tr	S_VP_.	Talking to her seemed about as fun as calling Gabe and having him run me over with his car .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I closed my eyes .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you have one Martini too many and laugh in the company of strange men so loudly and heartily that your eyes teared up ?
tr	OTHER	By her literal teeth .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The last time she made this confession her best friend abandoned her .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely there 'd be a less dramatic , and simpler , way to arrange his disappearance .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps that is an alternative .
tr	NP_VP_.	The ambassador sat at the table , which was piled high with food .
tr	NP_PP_.	The thin silk of her blouse .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For some reason Manuel 's idea was the only thing that popped into his head .
tr	VP_.	shot the girl in agitated surprise .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As a child she had stood and stared at it even though it made her feel vaguely uncomfortable .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I do that ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you think I had you pinned , Commissioner ?
tr	S_VP_.	To lose the world around me would be a relief to my senses .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did anyone really believe that ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Yet he couldn 't say why .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In some regards I did have to pretend .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How he had stepped forward to shield them and even faced the foul creature to protect them .
tr	VP_.	Be careful not to shoot your teammates .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Jacob pulled a spoon from the drawer with half the anticipation he 'd felt when starting the meal .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were dogs allowed fries ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she rang off without giving Sibyl a chance to say good-bye .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whether they lived or died depended on all of them having level heads and staying in the moment .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As if it was embedded in every pore and was now so extreme it exterminated anyone who threatened me .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He was referring to Elliot , who had failed to meet my father 's impossible standards the moment he learned of his existence .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She no longer hoped to trust him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He never tells Seth much of anything .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Eventually it hit a tree and stopped .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I think of the tender way Ethan holds me .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because I feel like an utter loser .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And they threatened to use military force to get you back .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had I never thought about it before ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Very few are even forced to take their third choice .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And a little concerned about the rest of us .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Throwing back his head he began to laugh .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I let him take me to the bedroom and have me .
tr	NP_VP_.	A bowl sat in front of her , filled with rice , chicken , and eight delectable vegetables in a brown sauce .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they went on to other things .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I follow her instructions and use the mirror in front to see the reflection in the one she 's holding up to my shirtless back .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Gabriel immediately shot out of his chair .
tr	OTHER	Is the prose enough ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Now if she could only find apartment 1129 and somehow get Penney Richmond to speak to her .
tr	NP_VP_.	Kathleen popped to attention .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I learned to look past them , right into his heart .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now we were driving back to the Savage house , an uncomfortable silence in the truck as I drove .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The door opens and I feel her soft , tough and gentle at the same time , hand on my back .
tr	VP_.	Leave by the main road .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now she was starting to doubt that miracle .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	There was no comparison between Iain 's powerful body and those of the men she 'd been with before .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When they arrived on scene they found both victims had been fatally shot .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he thought of Rita , back in his camper .
tr	S_VP_.	To make him understand what he was doing .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That I 'd walked away .
tr	NP_VP_.	The mouse began to stir as they readied themselves and soon was on his feet .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you think she 'd just magically forget everything that happened ?
tr	OTHER	Would there have been a receipt ?
tr	VP_.	Meet us there when you can .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Adri sped off to the right .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	when he thought she wasn 't looking .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many foolish fears .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know her fad ' ra ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I have my mother 's , I said .
tr	OTHER	When she captures my lip between her teeth a noise very much like a growl comes from me , making its way from my mouth to hers .
tr	VP_.	Wanted to bite him , actually , and not in affection .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He also refused to let Kelly do it , so Kelly was left with nothing to do but watch Nick fill out paperwork .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What will Cricket say when I show up ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Or still didn 't .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was it about this tiny woman that brought me to my knees so quickly ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He would continue to tell himself that .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it is you up there in that shack ?
tr	OTHER	Not while he was breathing .
tr	VP_.	Don 't let the pain take control .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She wore a black leather corset with metal studs and a pair of the tightest leather pants I 'd ever seen .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What sort of monster was he ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he stuck his hand in his pocket and produced a five .
tr	VP_.	Describe everything you saw and did , in detail .
tr	VP_.	Found out that the army had captured some girl and was holding her downtown .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes Grandma got al sorts of details when she had one of her visions , seeing the future with sharp , crystal clarity .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the guilt would overcome her .
tr	S_VP_.	To say it was unusual to have so many of the undead gathered would be putting it mildly .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When his eyes lock on the name ' Fuller 's Office ' he hits the ' call ' button and waits .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Until then Regalia is ruled by the council .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We seem to have a situation here and I need for all of you to please vacate the area .
tr	NP_VP_.	I laughed and started the rhythm again .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of Will removing the splinter from my finger when I was safe .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe they would think she was the victim of a serial killer .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her voice balances out and she almost sounds like her normal self again .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If only she 'd had a fan .
tr	S_VP_.	Just getting out of the building was a relief .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Cheyenne couldn 't seem to stop herself .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" The hell with going back to Summer !"
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Summer and Rhea suddenly stand where they are and start with the chorus while I look over to Knox and shrug .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What could they have in common ?
tr	VP_.	Thank god we found weapons .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" One on each side ."
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every week we had a steady stream of casualties .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did they find when they searched the house ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But unfortunately Alcott wasn 't to be intimidated .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As if he were afraid she couldn 't handle him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the shopping basket of ingredients for meaning to life contains energy , space , time and consciousness .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Believe what you want about me and everything I 've told you .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that was the kicker .
tr	VP_.	Don 't blame her .
tr	S_VP_.	Being a lawyer was already in her blood .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she know she was staring at him that way , that she was practically ogling him with desire ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What else could make an ambush like that successful ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did he look at her so intently when he said that ?
tr	S_VP_.	Letting him know that even though she wasn 't with him physically , she would be with him spiritually .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The next morning I was awakened by the heavy thud of someone jumping on my bed .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When would it all end ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So another way evolved .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why should this be ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What better monsters are these ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But not even divine intervention -- as some called it -- could not save us .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She just started coming on to me .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But none of the team , until it was too late , would associate himself openly with the suggestion .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I looked at him .
tr	S_VP_.	"Smelling like the grave seemed to be the "" in "" thing amongst Jack 's lot ."
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way it felt .
tr	OTHER	Is it someone from the band ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was he working for then ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	"I just want you to say "" I was responsible for breaking the cup ."
tr	OTHER	Had they burned her flesh ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she know how she 'd moaned and when he took a little time between strokes , she 'd whimpered as if he left her ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So our mission was to seek worlds that might have competing claim , and break bread with them - if possible , make a deal .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Sye began but Zook simply shouted over him .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you say you were a retired cop ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The angular planes of his legs and stomach .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he did , calling out my name as I were the best thing he 'd ever felt .
tr	OTHER	Then a door flew open and Preston got out .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the change in topics took her a moment to assimilate .
tr	NP_PP_.	Maggie pinned Jeanne with a look .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Voices shout from behind me and Terry buries her face into my shoulder .
tr	NP_VP_.	I was sure it cost more than every piece of furniture in my apartment .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Had I had a recent tetanus shot ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She shoved her hands into the pockets of his jacket .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Abruptly he turned and headed for the exit .
tr	VP_.	Doin ' the standards right now .
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting alone in the access room reminded Kenneth of those class periods .
tr	OTHER	On the right was a small strip mall , also with a parking lot full of cars .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they continued up the ditch until they came to a u-shaped concrete storm drain that ran under the perimeter fence .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At first glance it was a passenger train headed for an exciting destination .
tr	VP_.	Take a look at Gordon Farnsworth .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe this will make my parents realize that I 'm old enough to hear the whole truth now .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After the first time she had wiped away the blood with her drawers and thrown them into the water .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	With Tristram 's back turned it was up to him and Daisy to be ready for any eventualities .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And his thoughts kept returning to Sheridan .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Until he became obsessed with regaining the homeworld he 'd lost .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Naturally the booksellers , and the crowd of customers that gathered during these discussions , would explain that those Territories were inaccessible places no one traded with .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	""" So I 'm sorry for the way I acted after the picture yesterday ."
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Vena reached down and grabbed them , one in each hand , and lifted them into the air .
tr	OTHER	And that goddam New Year 's Eve party !
tr	NP_VP_.	Pack law dictated that if we merged our packs , he 'd rise to the top and I 'd basically be his property , of a sort .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was either that or lose everything .
tr	OTHER	Or was that just Rand 's interpretation ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But they 'd been friends too long .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there 's something to be said for some chivalry now and then .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just genuinely don 't know how to turn on the coffee machine .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Knox just shakes his head .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if she were a heavy smoker , which she didn 't strike him as .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was it only now that he was feeling this way about Alanna ?
tr	VP_.	Think how many points I 'd have over Jack by now if it was just me and Soph .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He leaned into me and looked up with eyes so filled with devotion it seemed unreasonable .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I sat down .
tr	S_VP_.	Hearing from James had become an important part of her life .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was Timmy going to literally steal the key off Smith 's neck ?
tr	S_VP_.	Watching pleasure expand her pupils and part her lips magnified every sensation .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I walked away from her , out of the airport buildings and back to my car .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she walked away .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not that Bryant 's sword was magical .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did someone tell you that ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his eyes glazed over as if he were looking off to the horizon .
tr	NP_VP_.	Hari ignored her and went towards the sofas .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Caleb 's blood suddenly ran cold .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What have I done ?
tr	S_VP_.	Letting her go was the right thing to do .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever he 's doing is already done .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Again she was struck by how much it was like watching the shadow of a cloud wash over the land .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had happened to Lady Ara ?
tr	VP_.	Smash , smash , smash .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Once he got word Joey had been rescued Serge was good as dead .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then her iPhone started to buzz , rattling around on the top of her desk like an angry bug .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What am I then ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because you 're home doesn 't mean you 're safe .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Sucking up to him and his bank balance was something that didn 't appeal to her .
tr	NP_VP_.	He searched his mind and stumbled onto the answer that shook him .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she sneaking off to search for the Bible he 'd stuck in the glove compartment of his Explorer ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it possible a previous owner of the lodge had committed a crime in his beautiful but remote home and the house still vibrated with violence ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Angry at the world .
tr	OTHER	Just my mother and father .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his left foot got caught on something that was not a brake pedal .
tr	NP_VP_.	I stilled next to Reagan .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I told him no but I agreed to hang around here in Arizona for another forty-eight hours .
tr	S_VP_.	Going in blind is too dangerous .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just as that thought occurred to her she realized the mixed signals she would inevitably send .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He then crouched down and grabbed the barbarian 's iron mandible .
tr	VP_.	Try handling a terrible two tantrum with a shape-shifter .
tr	S_VP_.	Even cleaning a stranger 's bathrooms would be better than that .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even as a small child he would sit in the yard for hours and observe any critter in flight .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	When she looked at him with the same longing he had felt for her he couldn 't hold back any more .
tr	S_CC_S_.	More figures appeared and the torches were raised high to reveal the six men and women that had emerged from the darkness .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When he came back outside Billy was standing next to the swing set .
tr	S_VP_.	Glancing up Beth saw what he meant .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that rationale was pointless .
tr	NP_PP_.	Eskimos in fur hats .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What day would be best so these men aren 't made uncomfortable ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he must have noticed the extended silence from her keyboard because he swiveled his chair around .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I most appreciated in Ruth was her disposition .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And some shelter from the snow now .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	"Truly ... "" Then she stopped talking and just held him ."
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe that was my gift .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did she want ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now it wasn 't .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I deserve his love ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he screamed .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet there were other things .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How he had healed from that bullet wound so fast .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I didn 't know Marjorie and Donald Harding at all .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the great Exodus began .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How would they reduce a life of a man -- a life cut short in an instant -- to simple black and white words ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he 'd done the one thing that would ensure he earned Justin 's love - he 'd married Justin 's sister .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For the Lord and Lady had just swept back their hoods , revealing their faces .
tr	NP_VP_.	She was the most intellectually stimulating conversation I had ever had .
tr	NP_PP_.	The hopeful swagger of a man who would achieve his goal at any cost .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He had no doubt what she was asking for and he was all too willing to give what she wanted .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now all he could think of was Sarah .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I realized it would not .
tr	VP_.	Turning on the charm .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least tonight would be a change of routine from our regular nighttime adventures .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At times John cried out and screamed his pain like he was hurtling balls of his fury far into the distance .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Only when he was inside the building did Severance realize just how large it was .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he looked out the window and saw the arrowhead staring straight at him , charging another pink beam .
tr	S_CC_S_.	My tattered clothes lay in a pile in front of me and I concentrated on them as I sent out a silent plea for help .
tr	OTHER	The following day she woke and her smile was still there .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She 'd seen a side of him she hadn 't known existed and no longer felt sure he was the man she 'd thought he was .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she won 't be much longer , not if you don 't come with me now , Shan .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What are the chances that there would be freaking two other Cardinal fans standing in front of the library ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was I going to make it through ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I couldn 't delay .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Settling more comfortably against the leather he flashed her a faint smile .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So good was he that Adam had considered him a likely candidate to become his successor for when the time came .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	To this place I would have gone every night of my life if I could have .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he found upon opening the door was of great surprise as well as a little alarming .
tr	OTHER	Word , even if fundamentally incorrect , had traveled .
tr	VP_.	Don 't be surprised when the volunteers arrive .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Any way I can .
tr	NP_VP_.	I opened my lips , letting his thumb dip inside .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The rock felt heavy in my hand and I almost laughed again .
tr	NP_VP_.	Hoyt pushed Ivan 's groping hands away from the steering wheel .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For those few short hours I was able to tune out my crazy life and forget about the troubles outside of this place .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One day that will be me .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I was a blushing mush .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	There was desire burning in her eyes , and he knew it wasn 't him she was afraid of .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On duty troops saluted as she passed .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I nodded and handed her some registration forms my mother was supposed to fill out .
tr	S_VP_.	Sending her back to seventh grade would be a disaster .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because that school was where we first met , where I first asked her out , and where we first kissed .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every night this week she had crawled out of her window and up onto the roof .
tr	VP_.	Make up your own mind .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I can make some calls to other Wardens .
tr	NP_PP_.	More loose sheets of paper .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she tossed her hair over her shoulder and walked on .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you want to see me miserable because I can 't do this job ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she think he was actually going to follow her advice , change course midstream because she thought it was a good idea ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But things were different now .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If she did Tony had better watch out .
tr	NP_PP_.	More clouds of smoke .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he was complaining about the way I dress , and even asked what I was doing on the phone .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Finally Henry blinked and shook his head slowly , as if pulling himself out of a daydream .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I fold the bag into a small plastic square and stuff it into the back pocket of my jeans .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We ate quietly as the sun began to sink and the world turned dark .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I don 't know what I was expecting but I was relieved and disappointed to find it remarkably similar to the rest of the houses .
tr	S_VP_.	Said the vicar with a miraculously restored voice without the Irish brogue .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	All these attacks truly sounded bad .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He had not stepped onto a field , or a pitch or whatever the hell it was , since that last day in Cleveland .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she held her arms out like a compass , turning her body , indicating the exact vector .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the driveway of the tower His eyes squeezed shut , along with his throat .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Hopefully she can change his mind .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As a child she 'd tried her very best to follow in the family tradition .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she was only one of the nine members of the council of nine .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the end of the runway the plane disappeared below the water 's surface on an elevator that took it below ground a good number of stories .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I really want to , though ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now everyone is well aware that I 'm a big baby .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the fish flicked its tail the wad of hair shot through the river like a torpedo .
tr	S_VP_.	Threading through the bounty were vegetables ; produce of the earth , the vine , the bush , and tree .
tr	VP_.	Experiment with the speed .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could they possibly fight hundreds of armed soldiers ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then all she was aware of was the fierce , light-blue eyes approaching .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although I 'm guessing that your inquiries are the same as your mother 's .
tr	NP_VP_.	There was no doubt about that .
tr	VP_.	Runs a hand through his hair .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She just couldn 't figure him out .
tr	NP_VP_.	The infected no longer their biggest concern -- but rather a new race which had openly spoke of the need for flesh .
tr	S_VP_.	Lifting the cage into the boat without using the winch might explain their attitude too .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Georgie tried to be more affectionate with her own mother .
tr	OTHER	Are the Many of One not a sovereign nation and a Galactic Power ?
tr	VP_.	Get some of that damned anger out .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	His expression tells me he is holding something back .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he approached and got a clear view of the camp site he stopped and found cover in a copse of trees .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this was Starlin 's founder and primary owner , the one who called the shots .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I continued to cut until the end of my senior year .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On either forearm a mounted disk of shiny metal sat with edges of bluish green energy already glowing as the spun around the rim .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Now she will be starting on the Charm Harbor High Tennis Team in a few weeks and she is exceptionally nervous .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But perhaps these machines were not equipped for warfare .
tr	NP_VP_.	Sam went up the stairs and then reappeared moments later with a black tank top dangling from his fingers .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the time it was recorded as a brilliant technological marvel .
tr	NP_VP_.	I 'd say both .
tr	NP_PP_.	Something in the water , maybe ?
tr	S_VP_.	To break the oath was to break one 's soul for it was bound to their souls .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That she was coming to him , to this relationship , in it for the long haul .
tr	NP_PP_.	One town after another .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We know you 've been lonely since Dad and I moved to Florida .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I guess you don 't have to change them every day .
tr	NP_PP_.	A week off of work with nothing to do ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	"In a great deal of pain the noble yells , "" I knew that she was a witch , "" as he looks at his servant ."
tr	VP_.	Pour two cups of water and a small amount of salt in a pan and bring the water to a boil .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He just needed to figure out how .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she think she would not expire ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How should she handle it if he approached her again , showed interest again ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Coffee always made her have to go pee and she didn 't want to leave Jacobs alone for even a few seconds .
tr	NP_VP_.	He wasn 't pretentious .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where does he live ?
tr	OTHER	""" Feel the structure , the fluidity ."
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the Ancients had taken enough from her already .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Uncle Tommy got beat up real bad .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'd like to take this occasion to thank some very special people .
tr	OTHER	We both got hurt by significant others and best friends and we both rebelled after it was over .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But you are smart to ask .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	You just found out what their interests were and then asked questions .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As she observed the very cellular level was transforming into something resilient and almost elastic .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I really just say punk ?
tr	OTHER	Knows a lot of people .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If she 'd fallen for him she might have considered getting somewhere together .
tr	VP_.	"* "" Mrs. Noble ."
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was her acting up to par ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I tell him .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	May the birds sing harmonious songs and give ye great fortune !
tr	VP_.	Guess we had that in common .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he offered , wanted to come .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	No today I am just me , plain old normal Martin .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she saw them , now that she knew what she was looking for .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they dream like we did or did they always have nightmares ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then her cousin slapped her .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did I do that ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did she think of her as Eleanor and not her mother ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did all these city people do , anyway ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If she offers me sexual favors I shall send her packing .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly he began to weep and bite at his ankle again .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least she could take comfort that even though Sebastian couldn 't kill Madeline , Madeline wouldn 't be able to kill him .
tr	NP_PP_.	A long , peaceful , well-rested type of yawn .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did she fight so hard to secure the White Tower ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In between them were many low swellings and bumps to break what in fact was a quite imperfect flatness .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it possible he had sat near the entrance all his life without even knowing it ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why should he care what I did ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The biggest one of my whole life .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever his question meant was not important enough for me to let go of him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	""" So this Beck had to be living somewhere he could take showers , wash his clothes ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Abby sighed , ' so much for him being all terrified of the boogeyman ' she thought .
tr	NP_PP_.	Not the stiffness of someone who has pulled some muscles the day before , though .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After learning everything that our other daughter had done to you , what she did to us was minimal .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'd gone and made a mess of things .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Lea slowly continued to head towards her apartment .
tr	NP_PP_.	A lot of magic , a lot of glamour , and a lot of fighting .
tr	OTHER	Could the man be that much of a fool ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have to wear freaking cowboy boots with that tiny little skirt ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From the resting spot they heard the echoed sounds becoming louder , like a deep hmmmm combined with scuffing and mumbling in a baritone voice .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Beneath the layers of dirt a slow , deadly hiss seeped through the dark , rich soil to permeate the air above it .
tr	NP_VP_.	The dress fits perfectly .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As I was only halfway through my mother 's wardrobe I became concerned I wouldn 't be able to finish without returning to the well .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What Sal said made sense .
tr	NP_VP_.	The referee checked a stopwatch in his hand .
tr	NP_PP_.	Contact with their skin .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Maybe being alone tonight would be far worse than any embarrassment she might feel if she freaked out in front of someone .
tr	NP_VP_.	Ben Christopher 's got that locked .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or at least she assumed it was a he .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Without further delay I darted across the street to the seller , who started in fright at my sudden appearance .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now all he had to do was convince Ariella herself that they were meant to be together .
tr	NP_PP_.	A lot of it , if the tingle in the air was any indication .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So a straight climb up the hive meant the pollen was in the direction of the sun .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though , she knew she must maintain her masquerade until John came to fetch her .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would they be here ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I ' m sure you ' re bored to tears .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the moonlight the curve of his mouth looked pure and perfect , his eyes behind the mask nearly black .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That you could get just about who you wanted ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	After I 'm sure the girls are perfectly in place for the night , I pair the dress with my red stilettos .
tr	S_VP_.	Saying that was still so strange for me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night he slept soundly .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But instead we 're somewhere between strangers and familiar .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Deja vu hit me strongly from every direction and for a moment I felt completely disoriented .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there was one sentence in the letter which raised a more immediate anxiety .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it was all due to Sawyer , strangely enough .
tr	NP_PP_.	The addendum to the contract .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That she thought she could drive just confirmed his concern about her being in shock .
tr	OTHER	Was it a coincidence , Anon ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there was a time that she could move no farther .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she looked ready to kill him .
tr	NP_PP_.	Part of it , maybe .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the last possible moment he swung his tiller again .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	While you 're there he offers you a drink .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he held out his hand , his own faded battle wounds crisscrossing his flesh like tiny pale stripes .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where was the owner of this smooth , measured voice that surrounded her ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	We don 't talk to each other so much and we don 't go to enjoy ourselves with each other .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Turning my head toward the front I exhaled heavily again .
tr	S_VP_.	Carrying her to a hospital would kill her , no question .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the cake was done they held hands under the table and made more small talk about growing up .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there were Tristan and Logan .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What harm could it do ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With a house full of servants I was able to develop a reputation of being sort of a rake .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I suggest that we all go back to bed now .
tr	OTHER	What if William 's sickness brought out the greatest excuse for him to milk it in the process ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Without waiting for a reply he continued onto the next stall .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of the retirees only one was questionable .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it 's a mountain of videos to sift .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With that in mind he knew and was confident that even Garcia knew that he could not be beat .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Only the younger ladies held out any hope that Alexandra would be the first female to resist the "" irresistible "" Duke of Hawthorne ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Riley : Well , [ He laughs that stupid , goofy laugh of his ] here I am .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What danger was I placing myself in by pretending an engagement ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I know they couldn 't have had a phone or you would have tracked it to find them right away .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the middle of the room a richly dressed chair sat empty of its occupant .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 7 I asked Petra about my Zander sighting when I got home that night .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did she want ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When suggestions started Danny the art graduate took pen to paper .
tr	OTHER	Had a car alarm actually served its purpose ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because he 'd sat in the sunshine plenty of times , but never had he felt the way he did in that moment .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that part is having a hard time being heard over the feeling of hurt that fills me .
tr	NP_VP_.	I feel like I 've learned enough about you from that one question .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	, and then there was a short pause .
tr	S_VP_.	To get this place ready by the weekend meant no sleep this week and no time to track down Charming and the Paleo Institute 's dig .
tr	NP_PP_.	No sign of the woman who 'd sent the distress signal .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	First it was black , then dark brown , then a lighter shade of brown , until peeks of green shown through .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he bent down , scooped it up , and tucked it into the pocket of his jacket .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If I had actually been paying attention , who knows what I would 've done .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How lover boy 's always telling you to keep a ridiculously tight control ?
tr	VP_.	Look at what happened to her mother .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I allowed to throw up yet ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	The color had returned to his face and he was sitting up in bed more .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I shrugged , looping my arms together beneath the pile of clothes I was still holding .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I 've had centuries to perfect my powers .
tr	NP_VP_.	She got control of her breath though her heart was a different matter .
tr	VP_.	Damn bad sports , anyway , just because we stole their queen .
tr	VP_.	Do you think the Divine Nature - why , it 's profane , ridiculous .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I feel this recognition somewhere deep , this connection .
tr	NP_VP_.	It had gone from seventy degrees Fahrenheit to negative twenty degrees Fahrenheit in less than an hour that night .
tr	S_VP_.	Playing over and over again in his mind was the final courtroom scene .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she knows of the Friends of the Guardians ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	"Maybe it was because she wondered so often if she 'd ever really known him ... "" Madison ?"
tr	S_VP_.	Searching for Patrick in a city as vast as London is like trying to find the proverbial needle in a haystack .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	This wasn 't how this was supposed to have worked .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she wondered why that surprised her .
tr	VP_.	""" Going after what ?"
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How many times since seeing Lexie and Rodney together had he checked on her , only to feel foolish when he spotted her car at the library ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At this point we didn 't know how involved she was with this operation .
tr	S_VP_.	Wishing and fearing were modes of consciousness for which he seemed to have lost the faculty .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If she 'd landed on top of a building maybe she 'd be able to see me down here .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he have the key ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Now Buck was in it , tossing his head a little above the waving stems of the grass he would be eating .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Except the words to convince him wouldn 't come .
tr	OTHER	Just concentrate on healing .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time she knew it was final .
tr	NP_PP_.	Yourself or one of your friends ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Again and again she spun letting her wings flap up and down .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He knew my voice and it made him shiver .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then the whole legion would raise their right fists in the air and shout as one , "" KING JAMES "" , the sound carrying for miles ."
tr	S_CC_S_.	She leaned closer and I could see Mr. Dyson wanting to pull her back .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She realized she 'd missed him even more than she had imagined and to see him again was beyond wonderful .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But one of the women who died here was blonde , and when her hair begins to burn , all I can see is April 's face .
tr	NP_PP_.	No question about it .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was I supposed to have a conversation with Helen alone ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They all loved it , and wondered why he didn 't eat the last piece .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" All of it ."
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	when I got down there closer there was really no mistaken it .
tr	NP_PP_.	Talk to no one unless they talk to you first .
tr	NP_PP_.	Just a word to the wise .
tr	VP_.	Shouldn 't have tried to explain that I was Old Nick 's descendant .
tr	OTHER	All of a sudden , Holly looks at Cori and they both start laughing their asses off .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the heart of a great pyramid they discovered the dead king with the Talisman around his neck .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Debbie , Alice and their small band of Generals took their recruiting speeches to the corners of the world most humans know nothing about .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Instead it has a pressure door on the side and a retractable ladder .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she was right .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Amazingly he was as calm as a Hindu cow .
tr	NP_VP_.	The two men nodded .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could you ruin my life on purpose ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he buy you this locket ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Off the coast of California and the Baha in Mexico there resides a very important ingredient to our potion .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I heard some - thing that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He still lowered his voice a notch .
tr	VP_.	Hear how he calls me son .
tr	S_VP_.	Feeling far too good at the moment with his hot hands searing an even hotter brand onto her skin .
tr	VP_.	"Let me refill it - "" I reached to grab the bucket again ."
tr	S_VP_.	Finding another way may be possible , but could take a very long time .
tr	NP_VP_.	He gave her the same sensation as the journal did : the sense of magic , of possibility , of anxious danger .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With gasoline prices skyrocketing she had no idea how she would make the money serve that long .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I even have a choice in my life ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The videos are categorized in fifteen minute intervals .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By the time he got back to the potato field his shoulders were burning and his hands clutched tight .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After his initial skepticism George seemed to find Andrew 's venture into wearing clothes curious and amusing .
tr	NP_PP_.	A new knife for each person , and a new choice .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is growth , completion , development ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When we brushed our teeth together he mimicked my technique and kept winking at me , showing me those sexy eyes of his .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He wondered whether in another few years he would remember anything at all about his life in New York or the person he used to be .
tr	NP_VP_.	He dribbled the ball and cocked his head at me .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she 'd believed him when he said he thought it was fantastic .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He turned to his father but there was no one there , only air and a land of emptiness and pain .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And this was a job , after all .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before I could react he shoved a rag into my mouth .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All Michael 's ideas about the spring came pouring out of him like a torrent .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe one of us would get over the gate in time .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he bear a gift or a weapon ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Ambulance They let Layla go with him in the ambulance .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After a few minutes he headed towards Oak Island .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because you don 't want to lose him .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That she loved him .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I will return to her .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I see you 've settled in to your rooms and trust you 've been made comfortable .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I hear a thump , thump , thump , thump as someone comes up the stairs onto the platform .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By betting on men underestimating her at cards , and now by suggesting she was a helpless little lady who 'd been manhandled .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When she jumped off and looked back the gnome was gone .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't she want it too ?
tr	VP_.	Thanks so much for the wonderful evening .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After a moment Hannah realized it wasn 't an illusion .
tr	NP_PP_.	One of the living .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they all took a spot sitting down in a circle .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And there were always fucking sounds .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When it came to morning he wasn 't to be seen .
tr	VP_.	' Yes , by the shops .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But life is for living and enjoying not hiding in a corner , and now is your time .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he 'd hit the ten I let myself exhale .
tr	OTHER	Does Scott appreciate his supplemental rental income ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they identify themselves ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Not since I started calling him Patch .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Before Christopher she hadn 't realized how lonely she 'd become .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did that mean at all ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I don 't ask , though I want to , badly .
tr	NP_PP_.	His favorite old joke from when we were kids .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She then slowed the car down dramatically to match the pace of the other cars .
tr	VP_.	"The automatons could 've torched it and ... "" And all those people ."
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then their sight .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was her real story ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I smiled and ran my hand through his dark curls .
tr	OTHER	Was that enough though ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were they wearing shirts proclaiming the difference ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe just the fact that I think something doesn 't smell right .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He apparently just finished shooting this season 's show and has a couple of weeks off .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because you are older does not mean you do not need it .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Tessa 's father heartily approved this sentiment .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I still wearing my heels when he finally brought it on home and shouted my name ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But seldom his name was used .
tr	VP_.	Spending my aimless days drifting through a sea of titles .
tr	NP_VP_.	He 'd been there for some time peeking through the window and watching the woman .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once it reached the midway point to downtown the train rode nonstop for twenty-five minutes .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And his gut wasn 't often wrong .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only Ric knew he 'd named the cat that because most of the time he felt like he was alone on an island .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What were they exactly ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did these things mean ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Let 's just go .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I 'm going to need your help here , Vinny .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Someday he 'd understand and while he might not thank me now , I knew he would later .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If you died in your dreams did you die in the world or did some part of you just disappear forever ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where were the rest ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if the man working on her property were her man .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we grant Run Fast more thought than we would have last night .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he walked off .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly a computer simulation of his angry voice sounded into the ear piece .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Putting the two of them together they formed what was not exactly a thought , not exactly a picture .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Five days later his secretary entered the same eighteen access numbers on her copier on the second floor .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I had a job to do , a work ethic for the forbidden .
tr	S_CC_S_.	My gaze shifts and I am looking over at the defunct train bridge where Miranda took her last step .
tr	OTHER	* He tried to talk to Scores about it , explaining to his friend how the winking out of each consciousness upon death tormented him .
tr	OTHER	His mother probably still had the number .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In mid-November she discovered she was pregnant .
tr	OTHER	Victor put his arm around me and then he kissed my head .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean that if someone was lying , the Secret Service would just ignore them ?
tr	NP_VP_.	They arrived in another large room .
tr	NP_PP_.	The hell with Whitney or anyone else who wants to step on our happiness .
tr	NP_VP_.	There was no more camaraderie , no more awkwardness or humour in his voice .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Loraine 's sister gladly took one .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Still I don 't appreciate the unannounced ambush .
tr	S_VP_.	Coming in tomorrow would make more sense .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the guys yelling something about how I did him wrong while I loaded my gun I tried to remember if I ever met the guy .
tr	NP_PP_.	Three fifteen in the morning .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did drugs do things like that to you ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Heck of a way to spend Christmas Eve .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you have been able to hold your tongue , at this point your request shall be heard by His Majesty .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It only made me want to see him more .
tr	VP_.	To get my story straight .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Within seconds she was fast asleep .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That maybe to lure one out into the open would cause your own death ?
tr	NP_VP_.	It had definitely been too long since she 'd seen him .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you were my real friend you 'd want to come with me .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When mother discovered us she made desperate attempts to retrieve as many as she could while we stood silently and watched her frantic hands and twisted face .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before he can make the choice the golden bird lands in between the two combatants confusing Argus .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One thing he knew , to preserve his sanity he would have to do his best to resist Samantha Fox and her feminine charms .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was I without my wolf skin ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She thought he was still married ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where am I supposed to sleep ?
tr	S_VP_.	Mixed in with these charming buildings were more modern constructions .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And still he canted .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Behind me I could hear little scratching noises and tiny voices whispering , though I couldn 't make out the words .
tr	S_VP_.	Pissing him off was not going to work .
tr	VP_.	Use your gifts , all of them .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he curious to meet him now ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did anyone tell you that ?
tr	OTHER	Please don 't take her from me .
tr	VP_.	Otherwise known as demons and devils to ordinary human beings .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they could get married ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the odious man stretched , just grazing her shoulder as his arm flew above his head .
tr	NP_PP_.	Her body underneath me .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whether he 'd resented Cain 's presence in his life .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It always paid to be polite to those who paid you .
tr	OTHER	Would Matt or Eli know what it had meant ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Jude stood and reached for the bag .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did you say thank you to a man who purchased a computer software company for you ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What a freaking idiot .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had he been thinking ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One day they went on an expedition , riding across country , right across the estate to its very edge .
tr	NP_VP_.	You could not have seen this coming .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she have known that ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	His arm shot out so fast it was a blur , picked up a strand of her hair .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I only caught the end of their conversation .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How else can I do penance for my deceitful words , but by casting myself into hell ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Before she could react his face twisted into a nasty grimace that she recognized all too well .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Simon had killed , or at the very least been a party to another human 's death .
tr	NP_VP_.	She read the title .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would he even want to ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that was why Daphne and the other Valkyries didn 't worry about giving off magic in public .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With his last ounce of strength Dmitri thrust his arm forward .
tr	NP_PP_.	Another pulse of sweet warmth .
tr	S_VP_.	Losing him would crush my soul .
tr	S_CC_S_.	At first the actions were uncontrollable and random but as the years went on , I began to assert some aspect of power over them .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had caused her frantic distress that night ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely they must have grown up pretty fast .
tr	VP_.	Move against her , as she had moved against him ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many names and birth dates .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For what seemed an eternity .
tr	S_VP_.	Pulling something over on Marissa was near impossible .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the end of the video the crowd surprisingly broke into cheer and the announcer once again baited the crowd .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she just phrase that statement as a question ?
tr	OTHER	Pain though she was , she was a Squire and that brought with it a certain degree of protection .
tr	S_VP_.	Beside the notes with the staples headlines that I have inserted all that is written below in the Manuscript is by Coetzee .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Instead everyone always showers me with praise and tell me how intelligent , handsome and well-mannered I am .
tr	VP_.	Being rescued and dripping toilet juice on Hot Guy .
tr	NP_PP_.	No sense in wasting energy .
tr	NP_PP_.	Something for every occasion .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not a man 's touch .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the look on Terry 's face told him that he wasn 't going get any more answers .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there was Addy .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She just couldn 't think of anything to say .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I guess all it would have done was open up additional questions they weren 't prepared to answer .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I was out of control .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She reached inside herself but after a few moments , she knew .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How you appear to others is not what I see in your heart .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were you masquerading as him , pretending to be him for a joke ?
tr	S_VP_.	To think about the underhanded opportunities available to a person with a law degree frightened him .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it couldn 't .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Needed this intimate , emotional bonding she wanted to give him .
tr	S_VP_.	Being here alone together was complicated now .
tr	NP_VP_.	It must have fallen out while I slept .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Delilah grinned and shrugged but never answered .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why then was she thinking about the peach , of how his lips would taste of it ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They just pretend to need my help so they can keep me close .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he picked up a tray and arranged it over her lap .
tr	OTHER	Possibly a foot rub .
tr	VP_.	Leading you in the wrong direction , making things worse .
tr	S_VP_.	Asked so softly as fear slid into her eyes .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He told me about making schedules , so I now I have one .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Anna quickly picked up the books and tossed them to Nate .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It 's the best because it 's with you and we 're great together .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would he have done with power ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did he want to tell me ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They all grow quiet and watch intently .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One day Blake came over and literally hauled him out of his room and wheeled him outside .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Getting past it did .
tr	NP_PP_.	A lack of control that had him hard before they 'd even made it into the room .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I remember this is all we have .
tr	OTHER	Please press here to accept .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I wasn 't going to let it hurt Adonis again , either .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Entering her office she stopped short at the desk where her terminal .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she not understand that ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was too late to think about what-ifs .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She 's obsessed with that damn Pinterest website and wants everything to look like the pictures she showed them .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where can 't he come after us ?
tr	OTHER	Do you know how hard it was for me to tell you all this ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her shoulders fall and she slumps against me , defeated .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The love we had shared .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I let myself enjoy the little shudders of bliss rippling through my body .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so now Earth broke it too .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because that 's how we roll at Orphan Christmas .
tr	S_VP_.	Saying I was done with Ryan was a lot easier when he wasn 't around .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she wore a see-through nightgown on an evening of overpowering fantasy , and carefully approached the door .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least I know that one .
tr	VP_.	Go inside , okay ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was I having such a strong reaction to him ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He probably would have done whatever he could to avoid marrying her .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But there she 'd been .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If the coyote believe you to be a wolf charmer then you 're not safe .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did he know about a hard life ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I walk to the kitchen and decide that Chocolate Vodka sounds good right about now .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The night we made a baby was bigger than anything I 've felt in my life .
tr	S_VP_.	Had the idea to steal Ali 's piece crept yet into Spencer 's mind ?
tr	S_VP_.	Jumping out a window would do no good at all .
tr	NP_VP_.	He crossed to her until they were toe to toe .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One day I was inspecting my treasure hoard and heard voices caterwauling through the forest .
tr	OTHER	Couldn 't you see ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever was giving the king his information was a damned idiot .
tr	NP_VP_.	Rema ran to her room and put trousers on under her dress .
tr	S_VP_.	Wearing only a sexy teddy , stockings , and stilettos under a trench coat hadn 't left her with many wardrobe options for the next day .
tr	OTHER	Maybe because he could not pull himself out of bed today .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Through the front door they went all the way to the kitchen .
tr	NP_VP_.	My memories of things past don 't change things present .
tr	NP_PP_.	All for the better .
tr	OTHER	So let me ask again , and tell me the truth .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	* * * What started out as an awkward car ride to Baltimore got better as the city came into view .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it 's enough to see a figure sitting in a chair by the window .
tr	NP_PP_.	The lingering scent of her minty shampoo on his hands .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	No way could she let him know that , though .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	14 June 1843 He spoke again today .
tr	S_VP_.	Trotting across the rain lashed square to the courtyard of the inn on the other side took several minutes .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where you come from -- it 's not like this ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could one woman look more beautiful every time he saw her ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How much time did he have left anyway ?
tr	NP_PP_.	No way of knowing , without further research .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It wasn 't just the images of him and Tiffany and visiting his killer brother that were branded in my mind .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she reached up and rammed that knife into his heart .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he was finished he pointed to the island ahead which was growing bigger by the minute .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Then Jase and the politician stepped between them and crawled out the bathroom window onto the fire escape .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then my mouth went slack .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He could smell her toothpaste and the lotion she used on her face and hands .
tr	NP_VP_.	He did feel threatened .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Eventually I decided to wait until ten p.m. in case she found her way back home after all .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't any of our expeditions ever return ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now you 're back to being the good guy , the one with perfect manners .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What matters is the time we each have between those events and what we do with that time .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you think he 'd stand in his corner and you 'd stand in yours ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did Iris know her name ?
tr	VP_.	Remembered the terror of those few moments in the garage , before they were safe .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Trying to will him sane again .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he have to bring that creature with him ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	My hands slip around him and I clutch onto his bare shoulder blades as my body arches into him .
tr	NP_PP_.	At least for a little while .
tr	S_VP_.	Running along trails had always helped me feel free .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way she moaned his name was music to his ears .
tr	NP_VP_.	I stared at him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'm limited in what kind of assistance I can offer .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" The role of my corrupt teacher ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I answered politely .
tr	VP_.	asked Jace , pointing to the restraints .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you learn it then ?
tr	NP_PP_.	All around my feet .
tr	VP_.	Be quick but don 't run !
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where is there to hide ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then he didn 't know we were engaged either .
tr	VP_.	Seeing him like that .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What happens in the Pocket is only limited by the imagination of those being here .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I left and headed over to the store .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For he also wore an apron .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Zander always reminds me of a tree ... tall , massive , and immovable .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had she liked this so much ?
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing a footprint left by someone else .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now Miss Level relaxed .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the cry and the wet thud told Robinson that he had hit his target at least once .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe they were so high up that she would just float into outer space .
tr	NP_VP_.	Thad found me heading towards the house , and picked me up .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we make our way to the concierge desk and ask if he knows a place where we can get a variety of foods .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time his face remained blank .
tr	VP_.	Call off your men and come down from that tower so that we can discuss things like civilized people .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was that she saw in his eyes ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For some reason , the bad feeling she had earlier seemed to intensify .
tr	NP_VP_.	I was lucky to have him as a friend .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If No Exit Presents Itself Remain Calm and Await a ) Rescue or b ) Death .
tr	NP_PP_.	At least for a day .
tr	NP_VP_.	Zach slammed his helmet on and pushed through the other drivers to get into his car .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But not so your mother .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Came the voice of Haddington suddenly and Garth froze .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I had a Big Mac yesterday and I couldn 't enjoy it .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	He side kicked the professor in the opposite direction while hitting the chair down on the outstretched cords .
tr	S_CC_S_.	"She looked directly at him and replied , "" For now ."
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before she could walk away he called out to her .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then I was thrown from my thoughts by Chloe saying , "" I 'm really glad you came , by the way ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I scolded myself out of bed , down the stairs , and popped an exercise video into the VCR after switching on the coffeepot .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On his way back still wiping toothpaste from his lips he bumped into Amy .
tr	OTHER	Just as there are now nine Elders .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I was smiling .
tr	NP_PP_.	Half of Lane 's capital .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he kissed my mouth and stood up .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now she was a vampire , too .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she already know that she 'd be taking me in ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Chapter Six For the past week James had done nothing but listen to what Josiah and Hubert had to say .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's the name of the plain ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Elijah come back ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is wrong with everyone ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Mission with your parents ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course it hurts .
tr	NP_PP_.	Called Clarence in alarm .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Kylie suddenly got an idea .
tr	NP_PP_.	Free from any morals .
tr	NP_PP_.	Every ugly memory of where she 'd grown up .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Lots of responsibilities ."
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why don 't you do that ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" None of your business ."
tr	S_VP_.	Standing next to him was giving me a size complex .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why wouldn 't they come to him and end this ?
tr	VP_.	Take that one step further and it means she also has the power to hide it .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he almost finished ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Which was what exactly ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" About fifty miles from here ."
tr	NP_VP_.	He introduced himself as Sato , and went on to rave about my Dragon trilogy .
tr	NP_VP_.	The dragon floats off as none of us know where it went off to .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I just wanted to leave .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe that 's why I should be in therapy .
tr	NP_VP_.	She 'd never seen a man more attractive .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he grasped her arm and teleported her back .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I block him , to be on the safe side , and accept his help .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The next day they passed through an empty town .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All day she 'd been looking forward to seeing him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He had on the slacks he normally wore , with a white shirt , the sleeves folded back a time or two .
tr	OTHER	Do you see where the air jets are coming from ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That they were part of the farm .
tr	S_VP_.	Traveling across the country to marry a man she 'd never met had to be frightening .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I 'm not crazy .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	There was simply no getting through to the people they knew , although that didn 't stop them from trying .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Dinner that night was good .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course they 'd be the first ones we 'd suspect .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	""" Do it "" Jon said ."
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How she could not really like him ( at all ) and still find him so amazingly attractive was beyond her .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then there was that unavoidable black extraction in between a line of tidy suburban homes , a missing incisor on an otherwise gleaming smile .
tr	OTHER	Either you can 't see it from this side or it broke up into pieces while I was staring at the trees .
tr	NP_VP_.	"Kat spoke into Kara 's ear and continued , "" Lord , we do not understand why this evil happens and why it happens to your people ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With some patients PT is enough to restore full mobility in as little as six months .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I 'll never get the chance except in cold , dry words typed on paper .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that left me with only one option .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On Ash 's bed there were a bunch of pillows all stacked up with several towels lying across them .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the actions of wraiths even fit into any kind of morality I understood ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How his wife had died seemed like such an important question .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would she know ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he lifted his hand from my hip , placing the tips of his fingers against my cheek .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With that he let go of my hand and eased himself over the edge , using his good hand to keep himself from sliding through the bones .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Nicolas , Tristan , Logan , Hayden , and , of course , Conrad all took off their shirts .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would someone create an army in Seattle ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there she was , the girl I had seen at the door earlier .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	* What is private I carry with me .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon there was hot coffee and a small , fresh roll on a tray beside the bed .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He now owed her far better than that .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All this time he had conserved her image and everything else he could remember about her .
tr	OTHER	Over his dead body .
tr	NP_PP_.	The sound of a motorcycle .
tr	VP_.	Going to gnaw that bitch into submission .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she pointed to the hallway beyond with one finger .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As they began fighting over her again she managed to slip away .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was Papa burning the refuse in the yard ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I took a breath to explain my situation .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She really looked at him this time .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe they 're meant as gift , some chance at a smile or the warm glow of recollection .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	An experienced soldier she wasn 't .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I play along today , even though I 'm feeling pissy .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I realized this wasn 't the time to be shy .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	"As they fell forward Danny screamed , "" Please be kind to me , portal gods !"
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As they went up the Nanticoke River Frank could see off to the right three hulks of large ships .
tr	S_VP_.	Being a hockey player brought out his tough edges .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he asked what happened to my face .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Her mind had been drifting back to the way he 'd parted her robe .
tr	NP_PP_.	The Hammer of Holden ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Most Christians today owe their Christianity ultimately to the work of monks .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who present the flowers at funerals ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where are my magazines ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The noise and smell of engines .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Colton and I decided to go to the beach and sunbathe .
tr	S_VP_.	Pushing my buttons won 't settle the score .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Had left me with a child I didn 't even know .
tr	NP_PP_.	Some sort of paintball professional ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Whistling overhead on a path to Aria .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now it was unthinkable .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What family could she have possibly given her the number of that she would even consider talking to ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I got into the airlock .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How the hell was I supposed to answer that ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Nothing but the dead .
tr	NP_PP_.	Deep sigh and change of subject .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What am I doing ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Sensing the dryness of my throat I forced myself to swallow , realizing I had been outdoors too long again .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today she would finally be meeting the woman she spoke so frequently on the phone .
tr	NP_VP_.	I would have a Shakespeare Christmas .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Down there it was a way of life .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What has this girl done to warrant another full-scale attack on the wolves ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now I saw something else .
tr	OTHER	And then with a final wave of nausea the light ceased , dimming to a radiating glow all around them .
tr	NP_PP_.	That clump of trees !
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I hate that I 'm the one who lived .
tr	OTHER	Can 't you feel the difference ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	People she meant to get information out of , or prisoners who were to be tortured for crimes .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he would find some comfort and reason there since Sebastian would understand the pain after having lost his adopted daughter .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A look of panic she was desperately trying to control .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But her husband didn 't believe the last was his .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Henry and Nicola were offered a Scandinavian cruise the following spring .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she represent death ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And my intentions were to contact peaceful spirits , loving spirits , and , if possible , Mother Earth herself .
tr	OTHER	Do you hold enough clout with Lisa Martin and other powerful Nephilim to turn them against Dante ?
tr	NP_VP_.	They did not care who they buried or what they washed away .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What was odd was Barrett being in his office over the break .
tr	VP_.	Wake you up so you could haul your injured back up there , instead ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he shouted the village began to wake up .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For of course it would think the womb meant safety .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he paused , and nodded toward another table .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Well do you know what kind of bird this is ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Instead I tried to pretend like I hadn 't lost my mind .
tr	NP_PP_.	The one with the abandoned stone building next to it ?
tr	S_VP_.	Hearing her name made her curious enough to overcome the lethargy that had kept her pinned to the chair for hours .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did any of them need her help ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she say goodbye to Rome ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Telling him it was okay to stay right where he was .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The bed she belonged in right next to me .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I 've done a thorough evaluation on him and he 's fine .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she finished she sighed and turned to Donovan .
tr	OTHER	And why oh why did he have to be so blasted alluring ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where would I go from here ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the edge of her vision she saw Gan step away from the horses .
tr	NP_VP_.	Julia held out her hand , pleading with Charley ( to put down the shovel ? ) .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But first we should track down this Mister Brinker and see what he has to say about Lawrence .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The concern in his eyes took me back and I blinked .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Ow , that hurts , Alex thought as her head shifted .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe they didn 't give up and let the wind and rain take them away .
tr	S_VP_.	Taking it as it comes .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As though he couldn 't believe the surreal situation they 'd found themselves in .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who did he think he was ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I wrote her a note and slipped it under her door that very same evening .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they 're some kind of immortal .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The reason he was making an exception now had to do with his daughter Gloria .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What they think is worthless .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just don 't happen to agree with this whole lake business .
tr	S_CC_S_.	You and your pathetic powers cannot stop the seasons change and that is my job .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did everyone know that her and Sergio had been together last night ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once they flew into Athens he would pack her off back to London .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so they called us a family of magicians .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And there 's the tension back again .
tr	VP_.	said Gwendolen , rather sharply .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	That simply wasn 't right .
tr	NP_PP_.	Just an actress on a set .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where the hell was I ?
tr	NP_VP_.	You don 't want to have sun burn in some areas .
tr	S_VP_.	To drown on the way , while he was still in space , just wouldn 't do .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If everybody followed their example the world would be a better place .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who does she think she 's fooling ?
tr	VP_.	Take your hands off me .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What they don 't want is protracted litigation on many fronts , with verdicts landing everywhere .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was she in such a good mood already ?
tr	S_VP_.	Having a supervisor on the school board hadn 't hurt matters at all .
tr	OTHER	Only later did it strike him that in the last month he 'd become someone else entirely .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was a Friday night and the majority of the taxis driving past me were already filled with passengers .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I react to that ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe it was childish , this old urge to explore for exploring 's sake .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I trapping his very soul ?
tr	OTHER	( 4 easy steps ) 1 .
tr	S_VP_.	Standing straight Katia took a deep breath and squared her shoulders .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I approach her now ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she love him ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she really lose that much blood ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Monk and Jason hadn 't been found .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet I struggled to take a breath .
tr	NP_PP_.	No talk of murder and motive .
tr	NP_PP_.	Much like Captain Diego .
tr	NP_VP_.	His knowing stare was enough to make Julia wonder if she had lipstick on her teeth or had missed a button on her blouse .
tr	S_VP_.	Hearing me talk to myself wouldn 't help things .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Still it sucked all the air from the room .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I guess I 'll know it if and when I find it .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who lived nowhere near here .
tr	VP_.	Try to get some sleep .
tr	OTHER	Was she going to kiss him ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Just part of the business .
tr	NP_PP_.	Another doll from Martha 's original collection ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	The Venetian stood on unsteady feet and Ibarra pushed him toward the mouth of the alley , pressing the tip of his sword into his back .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she want to see Gavin again ?
tr	S_VP_.	Feeling he could do anything .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why don 't we just let him go ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Something I may never get back .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Instead I close my mouth and stare down at my hands for a moment .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Finally I talked him into giving me his secret .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she moved on to poking him at various spots on his leg with a pin .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Grandma had to go home because her heart was bothering her and her doctor wanted her home under observation .
tr	VP_.	Come on down to Florida and relax for a bit .
tr	S_VP_.	Turning around right in front of them and going home didn 't seem like an option .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then his eyes darkened abruptly , his body went limp , and words appeared faintly in Damon 's mind .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As Sergio turned toward Mandi he saw the smile of a woman who enjoyed the thrill of victory .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	No doubt it 's because of my book .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If it was your family you would go .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he knows , so everyone knows .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I thought of something .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the clock continued to tick .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	"After the fire -- "" "" You said Rebecca found me ."
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Had he missed her at work today ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Rachel heard it .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	My eyes roamed , seeking the whereabouts of the voices I could still hear .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The leaches easily unlocked my chains and forced me onto my feet .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Sheila took another look around the room , assuring herself everyone was in place while Melanie flirted .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I 'd been ready for seven long months .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe there was no single event , no single act that signaled things had changed .
tr	NP_PP_.	No partying in the evenings ?
tr	NP_PP_.	A strategic hand from Ian that swats Riley straight in the crotch .
tr	VP_.	Don 't worry about that .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As I flew again over the mouth of the valley the shimmering curtain reappeared .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At that moment Bolster and DeVries entered the living room from the front , both with guns in their hands .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then there wasn 't anything to be done about her marriage .
tr	S_VP_.	Playing the number one seed , Carlton , in the first round of the playoffs was a difficult chore .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What matters is that we have survived .
tr	NP_PP_.	Most of the time .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Lisa was a professional and very thankful for the job and the money it provided her and her family .
tr	NP_VP_.	I throw my arm across the bed and reach for the phone on my nightstand .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His eyes softened and he gave me a tiny wink .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If he hadn 't been in such a stampede for the bar it wouldn 't have happened !
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Part of your heritage ."
tr	NP_PP_.	At least for Burton .
tr	NP_VP_.	She hasn 't done anything to me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Terry and Connor I want you to ensure that all the security systems are up and running effective immediately .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe we 're just imagining the whole thing .
tr	NP_PP_.	The last meeting with the cruise line .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What shall it be ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she even remember us anymore ?
tr	OTHER	Then tell her that you want to talk about gold .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Meanwhile Stone gave Hugh a look that would have turned Medusa into granite .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What she felt for Josh went far beyond anything she 'd felt for Ben .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then those eyes narrowed on me .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps I am just reading into his behaviour what I do myself with my own research associates ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I wanted to touch it because I knew I couldn 't touch him .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Whenever he asked about it he got the usual reply , ' later , son ' .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then we walk , silently , across the abandoned ship , down the pier , and back onto dry land .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What are you having ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't the animal look worse for wear if it had come so far on its own ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	A simple step backward would have broken the contact but she could not manage even that .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was that other Mistborn ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he told her .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he introduced them to her as if she were from somewhere far away , as if she had not known these people her entire life .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Being next door to the school grounds they think it 's a natural use for the place .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I couldn 't , because there was too much that had to be done .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Jasmine couldn 't abide the thought of relinquishing key evidence to someone she didn 't consider competent .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I 'm a harlot and I make no apology for that fact .
tr	S_VP_.	Becoming a vampire would have to be her choice .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As soon as it beached Davis and the others leaped out and drew the boat above the high water mark .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he picked up the file , too , and opened it again .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who should he blame ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I stopped and glared at him .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she felt him .
tr	NP_VP_.	There was a hospital in Wareham , which was closer , but only slightly and in the opposite direction of where Darnell wanted to start heading .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps it will happen to her .
tr	VP_.	Get home and get my father .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he knew better .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I did , including Finley and Izzy and the reappearance of my dad and Cal .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because I wasn 't so sure the life I had waiting for me on the outside was one that I wanted .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What were they doing here ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the smoke set the sprinkler system off .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he 'd bought her a present to win her over .
tr	OTHER	Will he feel extreme bitterness , just like the one I 'm having ?
tr	OTHER	Chapter 13 Derek On Monday morning I wake up late and realize everyone else is already out of the house .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much had changed since that summer when she 'd walked into my life and lit it up .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When had I ever been known for doing the smart thing ?
tr	OTHER	And looking so damn pleased with himself I want to throw a shoe at his head .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could you think that ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe she 'd seen the tattoo then .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you speak with him ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 4 In stunned silence Amelia and Matthew stared at the place where Shanti had been standing just moments before .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After the meal Chief McHenry stood up to speak .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Well , what sort of stuff is it you guys do ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If she trusted the look in his eyes when he smiled at her , then they weren 't anywhere near over .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Her mother obviously hadn 't stopped to think things through .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why can 't he be more like you ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He peeled open his shirt , leaving smooth skin and muscles and oh my ... a tent in his pants that made my mouth water .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last year you said maybe later , when I was older .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	His heart simply wasn 't big enough for such a vast supply .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As soon as she said the name , the werewolf realized the fourth person from the hallway was not in the room .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They all went to their trainers .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Ten minutes later we piled into Eden 's Land Rover and on our way to Kingsley .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like he was so focused and disciplined that he could shut out everything but what was his primary goal .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then she said , "" You should go back now ."
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Obviously she was going to have to spell it out .
tr	VP_.	came a sound like two stones banging together some distance ahead , but how far he couldn 't be sure .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her grip tightened and she shook him a couple times .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he let it drop and stood there panting , hands on hips .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I 'm not .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do I bring it up ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Patience wasn 't what was really bothering me .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he began to cry .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Rupert wants me to work with him and become a luke .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he saw an arm dangle from the sack he was understandably disturbed , but told what he had to do .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He opened the web site and quickly double-checked his column for any errors he might have missed .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I really want to see what she looked like ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever presence lay hidden beyond was staying put and giving no indication of its existence .
tr	VP_.	Move you stupid stone , move !
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What kind of name is Rat Hole ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And incidentally it 's because of Good Charlotte that Beyonce ' hates me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She obviously wasn 't having a good time .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are you acting like a hissy cat ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because a part of me wants to finish what we started on the way down in the elevator .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he even begin to make her understand ?
tr	OTHER	What about before the outbreak ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did that mean ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if to see if anyone was in hearing range .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I got caught up in playing matchmaker and I didn 't stop to consider your feelings about someone besides Dean reading your letters .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But first I 'd like to tell you more of my story .
tr	S_CC_S_.	No one else could do this and to be honest - not many wanted to .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How 's Sarah this morning ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was I doing with someone who is engaged to get married to someone else ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did they kill Miranda ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Something about that troubled Lily .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Before Beth could begin asking the hundred or so questions she had , the stun chemicals raced through her system and her vision faded .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean water ?
tr	NP_PP_.	A small nudge of encouragement .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Lights suddenly blazed on inside the cavern .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Thirty minutes later having left the bathroom the way he found it Johnny stood in the lounge .
tr	VP_.	Make the intelligent choice of what you do to your body with cigarettes .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'd just nodded and smiled , thinly .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she talking about sleeping with Jeff ... or what had happened last night between them ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I not warn you ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it was pretty apparent that hadn 't changed .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the wolf think that she was gon na pull some kind of shocked , Oh , no , you can 't have sex with me !
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he proved he had .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know there 's a huge betting pool about who will kill you and when they 'll do it ?
tr	VP_.	Come out with me .
tr	NP_VP_.	We 're having a good time .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Once they let us in we 'll have to make a break for it .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If only he knew a jinx wasn 't needed to spoil anything .
tr	NP_PP_.	The gold dust of any business .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it had been removed .
tr	NP_VP_.	Lucien resumed his seat and spun his snifter slowly between his hands .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She didn 't respond but the look in her eyes suggested she still had no desire to eat .
tr	OTHER	""" Well lucky girl !"
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I smelled the faint , acrid scent of a cigarette .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now he wanted to feed from me .
tr	NP_VP_.	Bev gave me a look with one raised eyebrow .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where does all the paper come from ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I hurriedly walked over to get it , noticing as I picked it up that it was far thicker than his usual notes .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have the bends ?
tr	OTHER	A sleek black cube about five by five inches all around .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In centuries past there were options .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Your sudden departure last time wasn 't particularly enjoyable .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We have our orders and they are not up for discussion .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She hung her old sword on the wall in place of the one she took .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Tara was always telling me they were fighting because of me .
tr	VP_.	came the jeering call .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he ever stop ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a second I wonder if Mel will pick up on it the way Kira did .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe there was a goodly supply .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if he didn 't have more pressing matters to attend to .
tr	OTHER	toward an unbelievable sunrise in the East .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I 'm yours .
tr	S_CC_S_.	If she had a secret , the world was an open secret and she would be closed .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That afternoon they paddled for just a few more hours before beaching for the night .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why is it that we have to grow up ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Not that I knew much about serial killers .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Running fingers through her hair she couldn 't believe she hadn 't run when she had the chance .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he began to rise back toward Heaven .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the elevator doors open they exit , walking slowly but gradually over to the glass security door .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much had changed but yet nothing felt different .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he didn 't know if he could give her the kind of good she deserved .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When there was still no answer I gripped the handle .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That he genuinely cared for her and the baby and would never do anything to bring them harm .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 65 The days ran into each other .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	In the following days she reads up on Sydney and programs her stay in every detail .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where had that woman gone ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where are you going ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just as she was hiding and keeping in check her anguish over the loss of her mum .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever gave her my description didn 't neglect to mention that .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she explain that it was the little everyday things that she wanted to know ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	He patted my chest and I felt a sharp pain in my chest .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The next few days Marshall kept his distance unless we had to discuss business .
tr	S_VP_.	Selling them could even amount to theft from the estate .
tr	S_VP_.	Destroying the swarms would be more difficult with each passing hour .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can you fit through that hole ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I felt it yesterday but I need to explain something to you .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there was nothing envious about her demeanor .
tr	VP_.	""" Another reason to go with the professional thief theory ."
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Even if he does make me look like a chimp at every turn .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Somehow Dylan 's sincerity killed much of her anger .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I would pay it for her if she asks , that I 'd do anything for her if she flat out asked me to .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Being in Kansas itself turned out to be sort of an ordeal for him already .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She often thought they deserved each other .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It reminded me of the pool at the hotel we 'd stayed at in the Bahamas when I was ten .
tr	NP_VP_.	The blood of the shining ones is too alluring .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he missing her the way she was missing him ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe they were soon to die anyway .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time she felt holes being bored into her very being .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon it may grow beyond even my cure to resolve .
tr	NP_VP_.	He handed Misty the bottle and watched while she took a sip .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But you can 't .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Had she sensed he had been about to propose ?
tr	NP_PP_.	New York City in which he lived and had his being .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why is he antagonizing him ?
tr	S_VP_.	Shoving the window open I peered down at the ground .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just as Alexander lifted off his chair a boom echoed from the valley .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that was the problem .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Plaka was seventy years ago and if her Lucian is my Lucian , we have a huge problem .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Lawrence silently processed the information .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it 's no wonder we have no physical conception of this wholeness of space .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he didn 't have time to fly to the club and fly back here .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did this mean she didn 't hate him ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not that Paris had any confidence in the man 's skills .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We better arm wrestle for it .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I knelt to sift some of the underfoot debris through my fingers and it rattled dryly , the first real sound since my voice .
tr	NP_VP_.	We 're both adults .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I ripped off my clothes and dove in myself , desperate for relief .
tr	NP_VP_.	This appeased his anger .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I 'd run .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He 's right and I need to get them out of here just in case .
tr	NP_VP_.	He flashed his million-dollar smile .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I gulped , wishing more than anything I could say yes .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only then was she allowed to eat and drink a small amount .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I not be a little afraid , he was sitting on a hundred and fifty pounds of pure muscle ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And usually there 's no trouble except what you 'd expect with old people .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	By now he would be in so much pain that he might kill her before she could convince him she was not trying to torture him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of that I 'm sure .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least that was what I told myself .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he actually suggesting he had made some deep psychological analysis of me years ago ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What are these three primary forces ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he do this to every girl he fancied ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it 's all set up beforehand .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But McKenna understood happiness too .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The sounds of a scuffle drew her attention and she came closer to investigate , into harm 's way .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I don 't know if they would take that risk this early in the game .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would happen to him ?
tr	NP_PP_.	No sense of purpose .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Ruby then pulled out two plates .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because love is trust .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it really wrong to shut the door for some alone time ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The other men watched , not even pretending they weren 't .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In as much as a small town can uproar .
tr	NP_PP_.	Most of the store of food that the soldiers brought along .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did I go up to the room while she was off with her friends ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I am not sure why .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I hear a voice .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I threw back the covers and got out of bed .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then a faint frown drew his brows together .
tr	OTHER	And the most recent one ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If he had seen me he could have made enough noise to delay the flight and have me detained .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that 's all that mattered .
tr	S_VP_.	Looking behind I saw a fire in the distance and made for it .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she regained her footing , her rage so fierce that she feared exploding .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As much as it freaked her out , she was hooked on the mystery this story provided .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I hear him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	A FEW DAYS LATER , fresh from an orthopedist appointment for her knee , Sara walked into her apartment just as the telephone started ringing .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But they chose Memphis .
tr	NP_VP_.	The first two days had been uneventful as they headed out into the Indian Ocean and then turned south .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When it happened the whole school talked about it .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they let me come today .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would keep Lord Somerville from being present at her betrothal ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And here I was again , ruining the good .
tr	VP_.	Shouts a voice from the ground floor of the building , Siobhan .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What else could she do ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	To Dad , he was the hero in his story , ' doing the right thing ' despite the wreckage it left in his wake .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We all knew her .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I try to meet Kenji 's eyes , try to apologize wordlessly , to tell him I understand .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What were they up to then ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could killing this human be any harder ?
tr	S_VP_.	"Isn 't this - "" And then the floor erupted ahead of them ."
tr	NP_VP_.	She cupped my face .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When Milton turned to head toward the couch he saw her standing still as a statue .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he put a spell on me .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who thought up that new age crap ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would he even ask that ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was she such a mess ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not the song Luthor wants .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he forget me ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that give her the right to rule ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He hadn 't placed any pressure on her at all .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't she be like that , Fila wondered for the hundredth time .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And a woman who 'd made beautiful napkin rings and bracelets from old sterling spoons .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I left him .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't you call us when you arrived ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did I suddenly feel so vulnerable ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was like nothing I 'd ever heard before .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How 'd I do on the science test ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though the count 's remarks surprised me .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did it somehow have a connection to his horrible abilities ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	The more she struggled the deeper she sank in that slough , always gray .
tr	VP_.	Be good and give you privacy ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Her backside practically lifted right out of the chair the minute she saw Hugh .
tr	OTHER	We both stared out across the water .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because I certainly didn 't feel victorious .
tr	NP_PP_.	Almost as strange as being alive .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When the hell had that happened ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it was Tabitha 's turn to frown .
tr	VP_.	Cooks up anything in no time .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they realize what I had tried to show them ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The next morning they ate their breakfast , then headed to the car .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although she was impressed by two things when her father got like this toward her .
tr	S_VP_.	Told herself she was grasping at straws .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Anna began to yawn and she couldn 't help it .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What we came up with was that there was a section of the Rocky Mountains missing .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She also gave me the name and address of a spa where I could go get my hair and nails done .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	""" Hmmm ... True enough , I guess ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he wiped himself off , dust or no dust , just in case .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the only other person who 'd had wine was Jonah .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then he lowered his weapon .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this was the answer I had been seeking -- the reason for his interest in me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today the trees are numbered and protected .
tr	NP_VP_.	She collapsed against him , as if that small spurt of energy had gone and she was exhausted again .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Not getting any traction he turned to Fintan .
tr	NP_VP_.	It was pure exhilaration racing through her blood .
tr	S_VP_.	Being crushed by garbage was a common way to die on the Rim .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this is his way of punishing me .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he pretending she didn 't tempt him , regardless of what she wore ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they believe Grand ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Already the nanotech industry had grown into a multibillion-dollar industry and was continuing to expand at a blistering pace .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A place she 'd been for a while now .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She certainly must have forgotten about him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Adam 's suspicion really was beginning to rub off on him .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As he did so the medallion of San Francisco swung rhythmically , in perfect time with the tune pulsating within his imagination .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he tore his wrist from my grip like I was no more than a child , which I realized I must be to him .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she really want him there ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course I do .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"If there 's a better song than "" Joan of Arc "" I haven 't heard it ."
tr	S_VP_.	Cady giggled at the comment but didn 't dare say anything that might keep her from seeing the flowers .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever testimonies House Rogan , House Montgomery , House Pierce , and Lenora Jordan had provided must 've been sufficient .
tr	VP_.	Could be the same as our boy .
tr	VP_.	To think of him struggling to find a way to live , to provide for his brother .
tr	NP_PP_.	Complete with orchestra pit , sidewalls , and ornate curtains .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then we 'd drive back to her house and dump it .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many terrible secrets she harbored , so many moments she 'd rather forget , had happened in Rosewood .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What Ponder was worried about was the fear that he was simply engaged in a cargo cult .
tr	VP_.	Stop behaving like children in a playground and start seeing this as men .
tr	NP_PP_.	No interest to me .
tr	OTHER	And had he just lost the only thing that truly mattered ?
tr	S_VP_.	Going back to an empty apartment and spending the night in front of the tube wasn 't much incentive to rush home .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But suddenly it 's like he can 't even cross the threshold .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't she have savings ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was he surprised ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I intend to find out .
tr	S_VP_.	Trying to dam her response was a waste of time .
tr	NP_VP_.	Quite pleased with himself .
tr	S_CC_S_.	A few said it was a trick of dark demons and they should search out those who were not of The Chosen and destroy them .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just need you to make that contact for us .
tr	OTHER	So it 's like really wild and we used to climb over the fence at recess and dare each other to play hide-and-seek .
tr	OTHER	Should I go home to Bon Temps , taking Eric with me ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The man disappeared into the building and closed the door behind him .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did he have to look at her until her heart thundered in her chest ?
tr	S_VP_.	How powerful and thrilling it was .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he suspected that she was still pining for the bastard !
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's she doing with your belt ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she ready to do this ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In her state he didn 't want to give her too many shocks .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he accused me of taking money from the company .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On the way he stopped at his bike and stuffed his helmet into the pannier .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What are you up to ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Jamie and Sean were inside the room .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly it 's super silent in the tent .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I 'm frozen in anticipation in expectation and I 'm so worried he 'll kiss me , so worried he won 't .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On a counter beside the sink sat a photo of Mick in younger days .
tr	NP_PP_.	No point in worrying her needlessly .
tr	S_VP_.	To ward off the wet from his skull Dan pulled the thin hood out of the zip-up collar of the winter coat .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that 's it .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He really had to search his brain for that one .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From there I took a boat to Italy .
tr	OTHER	And why was she suddenly speaking exclusively in the inquisitive tense ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we let it flame and dance between us .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he was surprised with only a short bell tone .
tr	NP_VP_.	He went into the wood and came out on the other side .
tr	VP_.	Latter he made her promise that she would never touch a gate like that again .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she had no reason to suspect the oppressive presence of evil .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Something he masked very well .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she want too much ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How 's it get up into the sky , then ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Jesse had wanted this assignment .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	7 ) Will machines ever replace people ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	You shocked me so deeply the first time you swore at me I missed a step .
tr	VP_.	Thank you for respecting the author 's work .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the soldiers advanced in formation towards the government buildings .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I know from experience he doesn 't like being put on the spot .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had Marcel seen ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the skull had become a skull sometime before that .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How would he react , she wondered , if he knew she loved him ?
tr	S_VP_.	Maybe knocking people out was Vaughn 's special ability along with being a depraved , smarmy degenerate .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Don 't you worry .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	There will be more of these operations and I can assure you they will not always go as smoothly as this one .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was to say she 'd end up in the same predicament as Priscilla ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	She didn 't know if Torin had been telling the truth and she didn 't care .
tr	OTHER	Or was it the ghost ?
tr	VP_.	smiling slightly beside him .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where did Dreamer get it from ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He twisted my wrist around and jammed the end of the taser into my side .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Rachel quickly exited the vehicle .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Sweet Harmony in hell !"
tr	NP_VP_.	It didn 't feel right here .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As the sun rises the demons retreat .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	There it was -- the firework display .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Elias was holding Malcolm hostage and as long as Michael played along , he would live .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And there I was , sitting on the floor playing with blocks , a couple years older than the baby I had seen in the crib .
tr	OTHER	But tell me -- what was that all about ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Noah was sort of glad Dylan wasn 't here today .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Where his eyes had been were empty , lifeless sockets , bloody pits ravaged by the destroyer .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He 'd thought of everything I could possibly need .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had Selena simply shown me the door ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	You could be stupid at times but what the hell , I am going to do anything I can to help you .
tr	S_VP_.	Viewing the trip as a forced death march .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there was nothing to stop the bloody visions that filled her mind .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now he sat with a straight back and a chin held high , boasting a solid confidence that had developed since he had left home .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had he done with himself ?
tr	S_VP_.	Doing nothing was out of the question .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he knew the right response .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Lucas slowly got up and approached him .
tr	VP_.	Hurt you so deeply , time and time again .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she carried Q them down to the kitchens to dust them off .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I looked at my friends .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Grabbing the violently straining pole he immediately discounted my contention that he was trapped in the rocks .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So damn glad Wade was alive as well , that he hadn 't been harmed chasing her into whatever the hell had happened below .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now Michael stopped smiling and looked at him for a long few seconds .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least that was what I figured .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But one or the other isn 't enough anymore .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or off a bar stool .
tr	VP_.	Thank you for helping .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I think the powers that be have planned for the financial collapse but they don 't know how the Middle East will finally resolve itself .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he kept to himself all day , every day .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because Claire had never smiled for me before .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They all slept huddled in a lump on his full size bed .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I always wondered how she could survive as a member of your family without taking part .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Finally we made it , exiting a few hundred meters away from my home .
tr	OTHER	The shadows themselves that seemed to give birth to more Fae along every corridor of the Bower ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although , I 'm guessing that 's not your real name .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Here they 're working with my anger habit , helping me see some thought patterns that were giving me trouble .
tr	NP_VP_.	He takes my hand and tugs , leading me out of the car into the quiet of the empty office .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if she were leaning on the preconceptions about Browns , using them .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now she stilled the hammock .
tr	NP_VP_.	There was no point putting it off .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The day he died .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon they were packing through the frozen tundra en route to another target .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Still the desperation to disappear weighed consuming and suffocating against my lungs .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have to remind him ?
tr	S_VP_.	Walking away from a high-paying job in favor of chasing his legacy was a tough sell in the rational world .
tr	NP_PP_.	' Why of course !
tr	NP_VP_.	Nick sensed her presence .
tr	VP_.	Let her live as my legacy to the world .
tr	NP_PP_.	Something for her heart .
tr	NP_VP_.	I stiffened at the mention of his name .
tr	VP_.	came a small , high voice from inside the station .
tr	OTHER	Just like that I 'm turned on again .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she looked down at her coffee cup .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He nearly burst out laughing at the horrified expression that twisted William 's face in answer .
tr	S_CC_S_.	They waved him goodbye and Tessa couldn 't help crying .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last night I 'd wandered in a wide sea of ferns interspersed with huge hemlock trees .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did that mean ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How the hell was he supposed to just talk to her with her looking like that ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The tattoo on the woman 's hip .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now she seemed to think being an administrative assistant at the chicken plant was the pinnacle of achievement .
tr	VP_.	See you Monday , Jack .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course Ned wouldn 't want her to know he was learning to read .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although , her dress sense and wardrobe had seemed to of gotten a lot better since she had been with Dante .
tr	OTHER	But he did not hear her words , enraged at both having been wounded and then his attack missing .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he honestly think a run-of-the-mill rope would contain me ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Waking her up with a kiss and peeling whatever she sleeps in off her body .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When she picked up the paper there was an article about an unidentified man found in an alley with his throat slashed .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they all nodded agreement .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe this wasn 't good .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What happened to him ?
tr	NP_VP_.	We would not have hurt him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the first time in a long while I felt really confident about the future .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Almost an hour later Frank found her in the lounge .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Zoe hung in .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Upon returning to the washroom the bathwater had run cold .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she doing out here , armed with nothing but a knife ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The boys all cheered and scattered into different directions .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So here 's my offer .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't she just concentrate on how good it felt ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she laid her head on Spencer 's shoulder .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Somehow he had to avoid getting tangled in a web of words that prosecutors were so very skilled at spinning .
tr	NP_PP_.	A way out at last .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Two have already succeeded and we may now see a real acceleration of the process .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Such a luxury she 'd never even conceived .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Michael had slowed his walk and now he stopped completely and turned to face me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Far more could have been achieved in half the time , of course , using automated probes and the like .
tr	S_VP_.	Lying peacefully beneath the windows , dressed head-to-toe in black was my soulmate .
tr	OTHER	"What if ... "" Jesus , breathe , Lila ."
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I didn 't factor into the equation was you .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because the reality was that Guy didn 't want a lasting relationship .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Without waiting for a reply Hypatia appears next to Kol giving him a gentle kiss on the cheek .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although the way we are currently behaving may sour her against us .
tr	NP_PP_.	A pair of fours .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I sighed and he looked up , directly at the window as if he had heard me .
tr	OTHER	Are you wearing a bowling shirt ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course it 's already been taken care of .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it seemed like there should be something .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there 's no point in driving her lunatic to do so .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From the day we met .
tr	S_CC_S_.	For that reason I was embarrassed by his offering and quickly put it away lest other boys notice and start to jeer .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	"An ' yet ... on the other hand ... "" He turned to look up at the captain ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After a few tries Dane was able to get through .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had he done to trigger her obsession ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just hoped she had the response to it that I wanted .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I dream something and then live it ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Turning to the singer Johnny apologised .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She handed him the key and he handed her enough money to cover the next three weeks .
tr	NP_PP_.	A man after Dylan 's own heart .
tr	VP_.	Think about what you just said , and then imagine if you were another company , another government agency .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Besides what else would she do all night ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I clamped down my distaste and slipped my hand into his arm , wishing I was anywhere but at his side .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We 're both panting for air and I can feel him inside of me , still needing me .
tr	OTHER	She 'd been right , I 'd known it , but I hadn 't truly gotten it until now .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now Miss Agatha was humming a lullaby .
tr	S_VP_.	Leaving it in place could seriously complicate his breathing , brain function , and even pose a risk of death .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last week he went back to Busan and visited the boss in the night club .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She 'd heard that countless times before and would rather he dealt directly with her attorney .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Thanks for what you did ."
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he turns , walks around his car , gets in , and drives off .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I entered the living room and he was still standing in the same spot and his face was completely white .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once they were both done the two raced straight for the house .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Alexis immediately went into overdrive , but never panicked .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would Susan think ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The only thing that the realm will support is the items with the proper mass markers which included Martin and his gear .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Somehow they followed me .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Which I had to admit was very thoughtful .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where is the Sheriff ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 'd you come here for ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't I react sooner ?
tr	NP_VP_.	His mind spun through the options and came to rest on the only conclusion possible .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing her almost die , twice , in one day had sent my fear level off the roof .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Her mouth dropped open as she stared at the lovely house , irritated by how easy it was to access the house .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe she was as flawed as everyone said she was .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So my job is to teach you how to defend yourself in ways that don 't rely on you overpowering a man .
tr	NP_VP_.	Peter thumped a fist against the hood and smiled ruefully .
tr	OTHER	No one else to shop for when she went to the store .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way she planned on walking now .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Bradley was the one who would get blamed and punished .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course there was a spark .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In his mind he thought no down time , no computer availability , and too much work .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it dawns on me what Trent was asking .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did you do it ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so it proved to be the case .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That she was restless now equaled progress .
tr	OTHER	But what could he do ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he was there .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you ever see the movie : The Sixth Sense ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As if it was natural .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I get to Main Street I try to slow down , but can 't .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What were you thinking ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Otherwise how could they move objects as they do in poltergeist hauntings ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What do you think I 've been doing all these nights ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Adrenaline still coursed through my veins , kicking my heart against my ribs .
tr	S_CC_S_.	My heart was in a perpetual state of sadness and the only relief I could find were in those cathartic cries .
tr	NP_PP_.	A kind of whirlpool , only faster , darker ... and that laughter .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Mary checks out the boy 's body .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I wasn 't far off .
tr	VP_.	Look at how much it sticks out .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know he was cheating the government ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And we got ourselves another body .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was that his way of telling her she was shallow ?
tr	VP_.	Turn that blasted thing down !
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she 'd been pretty much alone , with just an eleven-year-old son trying to figure out how to make her stop crying .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She finally sighed and straightened .
tr	S_VP_.	Making empty promises through a computer is fine ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Adam wasn 't wrapped around Rachel like Sean had been .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As Misha and I began catching up I could see Marina was not feeling well .
tr	NP_PP_.	A marriage of convenience .
tr	NP_VP_.	It looked like there was room for more than just the kids from my school .
tr	S_VP_.	Hurting her in any shape or form had never been his intention .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I respect them .
tr	NP_VP_.	It was also robotic but distinguishable by the sound of a helicopter noise in the background .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He reached for her but she flinched .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing what powers the newest vampires possessed was very important .
tr	VP_.	Curse those Warder cloaks !
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he 'd looked for work .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Or am I too late ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I was vaguely aware of Red Dress saying something to me before my vision blurred and I was shoved into the van .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the sun reappeared , vindicating her .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he bared his teeth in a feral smile .
tr	VP_.	Come home to me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just stood there staring at him for the longest time .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	CHAPTER FOURTEEN The days passed uneventfully for Alex , which made her long for the excitement of the hunt and eradication .
tr	NP_VP_.	She was more surprised than hurt as Jeff helped her to her feet .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It was just few paces from them and avoiding those was not possible .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though , I almost prefer yours .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was my schedule and the courses I needed help with .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they talk to everyone that way ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her body jerked and her ghost white face was covered in perspiration .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she dissolved and merged right into me .
tr	OTHER	Also wolf fangs , horse molars , and hematite beads .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As we left St. James I noticed a small glimmer of hope .
tr	NP_VP_.	my father said , sweeping his hand over the wrapped boxes on the table .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who hasn 't answered any of my texts .
tr	NP_VP_.	The pill needed to be at the height of its effectiveness before she 'd find the courage to actually climb inside the aircraft .
tr	NP_PP_.	Mom and Dad plus six kids ?
tr	VP_.	Thank you for all of your hard work , support , and most of all , your friendship .
tr	NP_PP_.	More than that what most people leave behind .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We entered the gym and I took in the familiarity of it with a pang .
tr	NP_VP_.	Jonah checked the clock on the dash as he popped the car into reverse .
tr	S_VP_.	Making her lose her mind .
tr	NP_VP_.	James Bond glanced down at the dim blue face of the dashboard clock .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A lifestyle he 'd tried to share with her .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I 'm dying .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Except Sloane , the woman he loved .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How good of an idea was this ?
tr	NP_PP_.	More and more with every passing day .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I follow every legend , every folk tale , every scrap of information , trying to uncover something mythical and prove it real .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In case I get too sick and become dehydrated .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps I was just being unfair .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she imagined how he 'd react if she ever capitulated , and wondered if it would really be so bad to give him what he asked .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she was gone from sight again .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she was good enough to find it .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was that movement in the cornfield ?
tr	VP_.	Kept his eyes on it as he stepped back to Pauling .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She was back to being the employee and that would make it easier for him to be the boss .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Although my whole being resonated from the surprise his statement had engendered , deep down inside I knew that he spoke the truth .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With a little sigh he plucked her out of the mess and started down the mountain with her .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So there was hope .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a very different way than his deep strokes were .
tr	NP_PP_.	Another burst of cheers .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	So maybe his relationship with the usual occupant of the chair wasn 't romantic , in spite of the red , red rose .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was only two weeks later Preston and Angie took possession of a lovely used Dutch houseboat .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" The shape of a pentagram ."
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But we didn 't find a movie until Room 32 , occupied by a couple of guys from Mississippi named Joe and Marcus .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the doll belong to this child ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	The more Tom watched the more he realized that it wasn 't chaos .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I don 't slip up .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did everyone lie here like some grim mockery of a corpse , jailed in the bones and sinews of their former life ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For it 's how I see you , too .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that tiny , mournful voice really belong to me ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For my own emotional well-being it has been suggested that I not Google myself .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He braced an arm on the wall near her head and she took an involuntary step back .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Someone I can talk to .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What were the chances I would find out , after all ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Our subject this week is vampire hunters .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that 's what he needs right now : good people .
tr	S_VP_.	Banging and yelling ensued .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Edward reached into his pocket and pulled out the bracelet he had discovered earlier .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And still he had not dared tell her of the feelings that were growing within him and would no longer be denied .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The organization they had shown when converging earlier was gone .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he didn 't .
tr	NP_VP_.	I watched Aiden watch me .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	To Rico 's knowledge she had no politics , no hobbies , no friends and no religious convictions whatsoever .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Asher asks and I can see his jaw tightening .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was wrong with Bill or Mike ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is he doing ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did his father 's death so affect him that he became a murderer for money or was it just money ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was Luke going to think when he found out ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And Boone was starting to miss his best friend .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did that figure in the painting look accusing ?
tr	OTHER	Must be the bird of prey in me .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How is this really helping ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's going on ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Here she was free , when she 'd thought she 'd die in that place .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For you and Xander were not sent here to be assassins .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whether his mad little warlord wanted to hear it or not .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Obviously Trey didn 't want to reveal the truth about his sex life .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" None of that !"
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They all wandered around the desert , looking for some meaning in the sequence of events that had just transpired .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the distance he could hear her laughter again .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was her own ten year-old son suggesting they kill a dog ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He had wanted to be around her even before he had found out she was his mate .
tr	NP_VP_.	He pulled him up by the bindings on his wrists that he didn 't realise were there .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do you like Turkey ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes her sense of fair play got her into trouble .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If she thought Nick would want me in a million years she was clearly in another dimension .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	And , if they went home , would they keep spreading the disease in their own hometowns ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For just an instant the upside-down it looked as if it were printed in red foil .
tr	OTHER	And amid all the turmoil and confusion Jack felt , all Maddie could do was reach out and squeeze his hand once more .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now it was just home .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	A quick call and she booked a flight the next day for her husband , departing in the morning at the time Sam had said .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was it about that drawing ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once Dylan left her apartment she could breathe again .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would Spencer say if she saw Emily and Kelsey together ?
tr	S_VP_.	Making love to him had been sensual , emotional , and incredible .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean they didn 't believe me ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he wanted her .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell was she thinking picking the coldest man of the bunch ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Sam then led the lovely lady off to the dance floor and smiled down into her vapid blue eyes as they danced closely .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But honestly I don 't real y need a fit , fighting squire right now .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When they hit that slab they thought something valuable would be either with it or below it .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Quickly the animal , once a man , was back on his feet taking three quick bounds and jumping back into the fray .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then her father turned her again .
tr	NP_PP_.	The people in the tunnels need to be freed , not just my family or Cooper 's mom or Casper .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night she hadn 't been able to kiss him as she 'd desired , or stroke his powerful body .
tr	OTHER	My heart and my soul .
tr	S_VP_.	Speaking to him might make me faint .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then her phone set ringing .
tr	VP_.	continued Grey on a related theme .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there was the twinkling fairy light again .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had she grown up so fast ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At any moment he was going to find me .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he guessed the building hadn 't really changed very much .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	This time the wheel moved grudgingly at first and then gradually became easier until the wheel spun in his hands .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least it would ensure the fact neither my mother nor Tad would ever set foot in it .
tr	OTHER	Now I really do want to die .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If he said he was going to do something he 'd do it .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the shiny covering wasn 't there to protect the walls from blood and tissue , but from the orange smears of fake tan .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I awoke it was with a fragment of a dream .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Verity 's fingers clamped onto his shoulders and her head tipped back as she began to move astride him .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His words had reached her ears but her mind blocked their meaning .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really live with his grandparents ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What does she have that I don 't ?
tr	S_VP_.	Being empty of cargo helped a lot , giving them maximum possible acceleration .
tr	S_VP_.	Simply knowing she was in the same room as him brought him joy .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there were other kinds .
tr	OTHER	""" Not so much ."
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did one say ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That he didn 't tell me he loved me ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The sound beat against my skull with such force I thought the bone would crack .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that include him ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I ignored them and made my way to the door .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For neither he nor his father had been willing to listen or to yield .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Black 's was unimpressed , his eyes telling her he was quick to judge and impossible to budge .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do I describe where to look ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He 'd been sitting there for at least twenty minutes .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Not that I thought he was as touchy as Silk .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it happened -- Raphael 's characteristic rhythmical knock at the door .
tr	S_VP_.	Getting back into class without a signed permission slip from the nurse was going to require nothing short of magic .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why do I suspect that staying away from him is the last thing she intends to do ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because you had one amazing dinner with the guy doesn 't mean you should sell your body to him .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he kissed her .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he scribbled a phone number down on a yellow reminder note .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least Creek was going with her .
tr	NP_VP_.	They stood and gathered around her .
tr	NP_VP_.	He sighed , pushed a hand through his hair .
tr	VP_.	Showed up last night .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She gleefully rubbed her palms together .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now here he was .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He still couldn 't believe she 'd been running around with bare feet .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then everything had changed .
tr	OTHER	Because he wanted more money !
tr	S_CC_S_.	"Gideon opened his mouth to answer - with a lie - but Kane , possessor of Disaster , interrupted , "" He couldn 't accept defeat ."
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He never failed to please the audience while nauseating his opponents .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The first time I met Vincent Timothy had us shake hands , or tried to have us shake hands .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I put my arm around his shoulder .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I grabbed her hand and she helped me to my feet , holding my waist to support me .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did this all mean ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I understood what my parents were trying to do but they could not see this far .
tr	S_VP_.	This dust or fog or whatever it is does not seem to be passing .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That she would witness him mourn the way he should because Aly couldn 't imagine anything more horrible than losing your mother .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The same way you withheld the past from me .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How were they going to make sure Gerard Dubois didn 't bother them again ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He even thought maybe he could hear them calling out , but he didn 't dare call back .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it must have been my father .
tr	S_VP_.	Devastating a man 's life 's work wasn 't personal ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had she been thinking to kiss him ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she want that hanging over her ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that 's the situation .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whenever she heard that laugh , whether by coincidence or not , someone was always close .
tr	NP_VP_.	I thought that since Claude and the sheriff were down , the FBI had been called in to keep the peace .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would happen to the people who cared about me ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was so bad about that ?
tr	VP_.	Take it easy now .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He rarely disputes an answer from either of you to a question he may have asked .
tr	S_VP_.	Starting it early wouldn 't have improved the end product .
tr	OTHER	Blood and no victim .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night Geir held a feast in honour of his distinguished guests .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon he was off , crawling up and away from the prison of his apartment .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet she was standing in for the absent parents , taking care of a child who wasn 't even hers .
tr	NP_VP_.	He sat down at the kitchen table .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she really think that a flowery top was going to make families feel better when their loved ones died ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And on the bed was Dean McDaniel .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Once again we undertook our marathon debates , which no human being could watch without realizing our differences .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there is no obeying them soot , not in this world .
tr	VP_.	Really a joke , far too easy .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he faces me .
tr	NP_VP_.	He walked with a bounce in his step and whistled a melody from a soap commercial .
tr	S_VP_.	Choosing a gift for Vaughn had been difficult .
tr	VP_.	Thank you for respecting the hard work of this author .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That he wouldn 't go through with it ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now there was nothing at all left that I could do .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The first years of my life along with the time in the womb are a complete blank .
tr	NP_VP_.	Jazz waited for a few seconds , and smiled as the grimy garage door a few yards down the street began rattling slowly up .
tr	NP_VP_.	""" Shush , "" one of the others looked worried ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	We walked through the encampment and drew every eye from every person we passed .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Then four other men in coveralls follow , to vacuum and clean up .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even though they also brought home two Dobermans .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she possibly think she 'd be safe in the presence of others ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Order from whom ?"
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Savannah threw back her head and laughed at something Logan said .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Raven never knew he was there in the darkness .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I realize that though it reaches over the eyes , disguising the wearer , it leaves the mouth terribly , dangerously , exposed .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What must she have been through to become like that ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I went as quick as I could .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What else was going up in that building ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What on earth is he talking about ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	His chest raised and lowered gently with every breath he took .
tr	NP_PP_.	A world in turmoil .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What you said is true .
tr	VP_.	Talk to her and pet her .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Guessing she 'd go into the shop Johnny rounded and fell in step behind her .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the worst part is they seem indestructible .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she doubted he 'd left southern Louisiana .
tr	NP_PP_.	All because of my mother and some unknown guy .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	14 ' You 're asleep , too .
tr	NP_VP_.	I put the rolled-up vest under my head as a pillow and take stock of my situation .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell was this ?
tr	VP_.	Retreating to the tip .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they crave difference the way I did ?
tr	OTHER	So what I 'm thinking is that older people , whose brains already don 't work as well as when they were younger , were protected .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I only know what was in the police report after the accident .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then they will all die .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Since normal Lizards started movement from the right side they expected the same from hunted insects and opponents .
tr	OTHER	Would I be welcomed by a loving family ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she couldn 't understand why Levi 's moving around would bother Rifle .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By all rights she should terminate him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Grace generally pulled her dark hair into a messy knot at the back of her head and wore little makeup .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe last night hadn 't meant what I thought it had .
tr	S_VP_.	Name he mentioned was Lytle Creek , named after Captain Andrew Lytle by Mormons who had settled her more than a decade ago .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know what I was thinking ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One moment he looked All dark and dangerous and on edge and keyed up for battle .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did you do ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now even the smal body was evaporating right out of Elena 's arms .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why wait until I 'm a junior in spy school ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the strange part was that Wesley died after being committed to an asylum .
tr	NP_VP_.	He slithers around in a circle .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I confine myself to something I find much simpler , the logic behind the appearance of humans and the reason for their presence on the planet .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she be sweating blood ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If anything of the stories about the magic of the valley made sense .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Quickly I pulled them back on , as my stomach turned dangerously .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he 's gone .
tr	NP_PP_.	Such a deceiving appearance for a big suck .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Yolanda exited at Wilshire Boulevard and turned down the first side street she saw in order to pull over and find her lottery ticket .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We 'd spent several hours yelling at each other and I 'd made threats I intended to keep .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And Joaquin was not exceptional amongst those who came to have the Mark removed .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In his dream it had not been dog , wolf , or bear .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Before that he 'd been a Pack wolf in the Southern Territories , but had been expelled for some reason unknown to me .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Bright but quiet , he was not unpopular but neither was he the sort to be mobbed by the girls .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How have you been ?
tr	VP_.	Filled him with warmth .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Stefan took her weight and gently put her feet down on firm slats .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	- Why did you interrupted it ?
tr	VP_.	asked my mother , almost pleading .
tr	S_VP_.	Destroying the four evil men would also avenge the deaths of Evening Star 's father and brother , and help to end the threat to her tribe .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	* After a few days , even I 'm beginning to doubt that I was rescued by some sort of guardian angel .
tr	NP_PP_.	Anything even vaguely of the female persuasion .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was the ' he ' they mentioned ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Oh , for one wild moment I was ready to let it all happen .
tr	NP_VP_.	He would never believe me .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If she 'd been a cat she would have purred .
tr	NP_VP_.	You know where they will seek refuge .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Before Pendleton came along and made all kinds of funny things go jumping around inside her .
tr	OTHER	Not after he 'd taken this big chance .
tr	VP_.	Allow me to introduce everyone .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he enjoy playing tonight ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where could we go ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if I didn 't know that anyway .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way she fought so desperately to protect him from possible loss .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because you hit an unmoving target once does not mean that you can hit that same target under pressure .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I still locked inside James or was I really back ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course I 've tried .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I think we ought to get a couple of those cans of charcoal lighter fluid all ready .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I really hoped that when I did awake , that it would not be in the same room .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although , Ed and I knew that their first guess would be the airport .
tr	S_VP_.	ordered Caleb and now all of them ran to downstairs .
tr	S_VP_.	Blistering male desire gleamed from his eyes .
tr	S_VP_.	Doesn 't mean I accepted it .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It was private land and she had permission from the owner who had once been a student of her advisor in the anthropology department .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In case he was only wounded , and might yet be saved .
tr	NP_VP_.	I 'll see who 's there first .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Almost instantly there were two bouncers on top of DG .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If she ended up on the streets Marcus would never forgive himself .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Callum 's triumphant face appeared a moment later and I exhaled , returning his grin .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I kept telling myself he 'd settle down once he bonded with us .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I distracted myself with an extra long shower , followed by homework , then a book .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a matter of hours the sounds of the march alerted sentries watching the horizon from our mountain fortress .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	"What are you doing here ? "" ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At last I got to Blackfriars Bridge and asked for Colman Street .
tr	OTHER	How to market a product so that a customer would be not only slavering to have it , but instantly convinced to buy it .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	"Of course I jumped at the chance to see "" the new and improved David "" when the opportunity finally did present itself ."
tr	S_CC_S_.	They stepped on the porch and Corrado knocked twice on the large door .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Already I had learned two things about my past .
tr	S_VP_.	Being in a twister was invigorating when you had no worries about it hurting you .
tr	VP_.	Jacob the very least of all , if he was trying to put himself between Victoria and Charlie between Victoria and me .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Eventually the young barman blushed in embarrassment as a cheer echoed through the small tavern .
tr	S_VP_.	Seated on a branch above our heads was a green bird with a tan curved beak and a blotch of red covering its head .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she treated him to a true show .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes he had hard work to get it .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he waited until it was light enough to see his prey .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Taking careful aim he wound up and launched it at the closest man .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can ruining two people 's lives possibly be the Order 's will ?
tr	OTHER	Lies and omissions , Nash thought , disgusted and angry .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Taylor immediately looked at Blake , who had a horrified expression on his face .
tr	S_VP_.	began Sye fearfully before a sharp gust of wind blew back his freshly cropped hair , making his eyes water .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the same moment he pointed at the ground , murmuring beneath his breath .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That I believed someone was in danger ?
tr	VP_.	Use his ego against him .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I am a silly girl and you know that well .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	More than just how good he looked .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I went to join Ruby and Lisa 's parents at the front of the church .
tr	NP_PP_.	Fear of being sent to hell on earth .
tr	S_VP_.	Listening to that long enough would be enough to make someone crazy .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it was his turn to lose himself in his thoughts .
tr	VP_.	asked Adrian , leaning forward .
tr	OTHER	Is something wrong with it ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then she had to teach me what "" mucking the stalls "" meant ."
tr	OTHER	Maybe during the next five years she would never have to shoot the stupid thing at the enemy .
tr	NP_PP_.	No parties until next weekend .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why stop at once ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Sorceress Sarah Sims recently completed her apprenticeship .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A couple of times he woke and immediately thought of Buster .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Damian 's voice beckons to Kayla and I feel the change just before her shackle thuds .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least none of the people listening seemed openly suspicious .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Exactly what I would do when I caught up to them I didn 't know , either .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How 's that possible ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the center console were two steaming cups .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can I choose one over the other ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" One hundred gold marks as compensation for the lost work and as a penalty for not teaching your boys some manners ."
tr	S_NP_VP_.	By the time the car came back to pick them up she was exhausted .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	There it was , the truth without having to burrow into the nitty-gritty .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Taking the body away from his mind and imagining it as the extension of the computer .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she was a beauty .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I asked this I got no magic answer .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are you sitting in the darkness ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	After he straightened he saw the man with the rifle pointed at him with his finger white on the trigger .
tr	NP_VP_.	He nodded and climbed into his car .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He watched her face as she listened to him , and enjoyed the shift and play of emotions she made no attempt to hide .
tr	NP_PP_.	Most of the time when painting , he didn 't bother with the shirt .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I was pretty sure that I was going to be okay now .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was I kidding ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps tomorrow she 'd be able to think up a better way to show Rand that she was on his side .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	And Pardon had called Marcus 's workplace the day he died .
tr	VP_.	Don 't allow yourself to be surrounded .
tr	VP_.	Proud that he was so strong , and brave , and confident .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I ever see her again I 'll have to be very careful .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did you come ?
tr	VP_.	said Grey , turning to face her .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then a great sadness overcame me .
tr	OTHER	In public , too .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where had his courage gone ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where would she be when he left ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Which one was in bed with me each night ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then two more guys came out in front of us .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he expect her to eat the meal anyway ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From here I could see her eyes filled with tears .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Finally she looks away and sits back down on the couch .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only then would she able extinguish the fire of hate and revenge that raged inside the pit of her stomach .
tr	S_VP_.	' Told you you 'd missed it , ' replied the snow leopard .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If she could call it training .
tr	NP_VP_.	Think , Enoch , think .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did she show up now ?
tr	S_VP_.	Meeting his parents had overwhelmed me .
tr	S_CC_S_.	They 'd already ordered and both had full glasses of wine .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One day they were walking in the garden when they came across a beautiful tree , more beautiful than any other in the garden .
tr	OTHER	Not just alien in origin , but a combination of both foreign and organic .
tr	NP_VP_.	I shook my head slowly , hoping she could read sincerity in my eyes .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this was the end .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today he just put his club back in the bag and walked to the green .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" That son of a bitch ."
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As we pass under the rising curtain we see high up the walls of the dome are balcony 's that presumably link to another building .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe there 's a reason why the Old Wing is forbidden ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she knew it wasn 't all true .
tr	VP_.	Don 't let it bother you .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From what he could see and hear he surmised there were maybe four workers in the room .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the evidence is there for everyone to see they are free to make up their own minds .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She drives away without looking back and I have no doubt that I 'll never see her again .
tr	NP_VP_.	Swords swinging and men screaming .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	* * * Presley squinted up at the single bulb on the ceiling overhead , in so much pain she could hardly move .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She almost hung up as soon as he said hello .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I shouldn 't have asked a personal question .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Baxter must 've left on foot .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As it is he avoided taking his seat in Parliament last year , claiming exemption due to his state of mourning .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why should I trust anyone these days ?
tr	VP_.	Pressing the button with a frown .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he didn 't .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was I asking a perfect stranger about his family ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	"I 'm just here for summer break and only because I didn 't have money to rent an apartment , "" I say and his expression falls ."
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she waiting for ?
tr	S_VP_.	Having Alec share this with me makes my heart soar .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only movie thugs and athletes had shoulders like that .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As she watched he let the arrow fly , hitting the bullseye of the target with pinpoint accuracy .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who the hell is she to question my intentions for Evangeline ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For Simon the drive to Florence was too quick .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If you believed that you would not have offered to take her when she was born .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had I come in here this time ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I put it in my room under the bed and forgot about it for a while .
tr	S_VP_.	Leaving you behind is another .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I decided to pull out the big guns .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Franklin sighed as he closed the bedroom door behind him and walked toward the suite he 'd shared with Greg .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the motion stopped .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A thing he worked on for the rest of the day and well into the evening .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She tried to take in the details he shared and make sense of it but logic was pushed out of the way .
tr	S_VP_.	To say things I wouldn 't think will be bad for my friends .
tr	VP_.	Did not see why she sought to comfort him right now .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she saw Genevieve she paused , confused .
tr	VP_.	Give me what I deserve .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who combed their hair when they were sick , anyway ?
tr	S_VP_.	"Grab hold of me ... "" "" Let go of me !"
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why the hell would she do that ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Protective of family 6 .
tr	S_VP_.	' Feeling guilty because he murdered his wife ?
tr	VP_.	Listen to the sound of my voice .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where did you get this ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Evidently it was enough to keep the monster at bay .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I look at my chronometer and mentally find the knob for seconds .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Until there was a shout , and the men ran towards the hedge .
tr	OTHER	For a moment we just watch each other .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That she didn 't smell like peaches .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	yesterday she had seemed so distant .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And there he was , dressed in jeans and a tee-shirt , his face cleanly shaven but still looking extremely haggard .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she felt him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I slowly swung my head around at hearing the genuine concern in her voice .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the heart monitor stops beeping .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he did was immoral .
tr	OTHER	So he just carried on walking forward intending on trying to walk past the guys on the footpath .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he reconcile the predator who moved with such lethal grace and the torn , broken body that had healed against all odds ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Devin whispered to himself as he scratched his head .
tr	VP_.	Merely a fleeting sense of satisfaction .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now we 're talking .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What is important is the way we act while we are alive , our deeds , our morals .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One whole week had been devoted to changing her credit cards and driver 's license .
tr	S_VP_.	""" Spit it out , "" said Fintan "" Okay ."
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they ever get past adolescence ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I do that ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if he was the one in charge here .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I slide my key against a silver bar and the trunk opens up .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way she snatched her hand away like I 'd just shot an electric current through her system .
tr	OTHER	Maybe even some more fences .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At that point Beppe and Luigi walked in .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Calling her a fluffy woman would be a perfectly nice euphemism , if you didn 't prefer the term fat .
tr	NP_VP_.	You understand that , right ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although I 'll tell you that most of the world isn 't half this pretty when you get up close .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we can focus on living our lives .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe he thought I did .
tr	NP_VP_.	he asked as a wonderful thought came to him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Vane actually squirmed a bit before he answered .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Garuda 's flight hindered Auron 's prayers yet this time it was easier since he had cast the spell earlier .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he felt the pain .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Once I 've licked her clean I drop her legs and stand up .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were they tears of relief , Zack wondered , or regret for killing a man ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In Star Trek it was a test of character , to see how you would do in an unwinnable situation .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Not since Morris said he saw him heading into the woods .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When we reach the others the mom of the group whom I 'm guessing is Amy comes and examines me .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But sooner or later the truth had to come out .
tr	NP_VP_.	She 'd scented his distress .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once that was done he chopped onions , chillies , lemongrass , ginger and garlic for later .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Had the others who climbed down here all died ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course that didn 't happen .
tr	S_VP_.	Falling for Julian wasn 't smart .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing him tired and vulnerable like this makes me uncomfortable .
tr	VP_.	Take a lesson from them -- get paid a lot for a little work !
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I don 't know what to expect .
tr	NP_VP_.	It had been a creepy week .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because she was fast losing her ability to think with her brain .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I really screwed up , honey .
tr	VP_.	Stay in the car , gorgeous .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she 'd asked when he thought he could come see her .
tr	S_VP_.	""" Then , what ... "" Leticia giggled like a much younger woman ."
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Even when she knew that her love wouldn 't be able to save anyone or anything .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I tried the door and then one of the windows to see if I could jimmy it open .
tr	VP_.	Could absolve her of all guilt .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why does it smell like that ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Father has improved and he will be joining us soon .
tr	S_VP_.	Realizing I had seen him nearly nak * d before , I blushed .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	A ticking red watch lay over a wrist made of clouds in the painting he was working on .
tr	S_VP_.	Told her I think we needed to weigh our options .
tr	OTHER	So lots of that crap .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then Abe stalks down the street , turning at the next corner .
tr	S_VP_.	Bound to be more than a few someones doing illegal activity in this place .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was I doing down here ?
tr	OTHER	Partly because I knew he possessed the heart of a monster underneath all that masculine beauty , but also because he lacked the rich vitality Lucius possessed .
tr	OTHER	What if she now used Cowboy as her lookout while she bathed in Siler 's Creek ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But there I am , knife out , my heart thumping fast like it 's finally figured out what I 'm doing .
tr	S_VP_.	Never knowing if I 'm making the right call .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	These sometimes went on for three or four minutes .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If he hadn 't known better he would have thought that she was watching his bum wobble with every step that he took up the stairs .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 12 I couldn 't tell you what direction we rode in , or how much time had passed .
tr	NP_VP_.	Parker moved gradually down my body , kissing and licking me in all the right places .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It makes absolutely no sense how little care some adults have for the children they 're responsible for .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way it mixes with the sky .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Each time it hit him with a satisfying smack .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why else did he give this sudden squee of delight ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	The vampires were hungry and she got the credit for the bounty .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And Mom 's right .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he hiding in there ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I reached for her at the exact same moment she stepped off the edge , into the blue-black sky .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	These things she had done .
tr	NP_VP_.	Nothing pleases me more .
tr	OTHER	That friendship you aren 't worried about , means something to me .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that 's why she was so inquisitive .
tr	S_VP_.	Sleeping on the far side of the cave were the two young women from the day before .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He tried to pace himself but couldn 't and managed to eat longer and far more then he had planed .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Time to find a way around the awful predicament I was in .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knew what danger waited on the other side ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I 've only been here for about an hour and most of the time I was stuck in the airport .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As the lights hit I was tasked with breaking the news to the people again .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Probably because he knew there was no place she could escape to that he couldn 't follow .
tr	S_VP_.	Touching the dog seemed to help him cope with the pain .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And here I was , about to make her do it all over again .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When it was fully open Teddy leaned out , smiling and waving .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could Evie refuse ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If Tony turns nasty ... ' No mental strength could fight superior physical strength .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	That really burned him up .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment she could only stare at him , lost in his magic .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What are they doing to you ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Well I could 've tried somehow .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the door he paused , circled warily , backed off .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So one preset strategy is to freeze where you are and wait , to ambush .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know I 'd lost my job ?
tr	OTHER	I wish , I wish I had time to explain it all to you right now , but I don 't .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Unless you ( I do not mean Gabriel ) have knowledge of an area that begs further attention I believe we are ready to start the countdown .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Frank busied himself devising a plan of action to woo Mandy then ask her out on a date .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of those ten hearts respond in parts .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Apparently kids this age treasured their privacy .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did the news get about that there was a Spacer robot in the City ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But maybe we 're rushing things .
tr	S_VP_.	Wrapping my arms around his neck and pulling him to me for a kiss would have been easier still .
tr	S_CC_S_.	They seemed to be roads but he couldn 't be sure .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he was long dead by then .
tr	VP_.	asked Amy as she filled a glass with water .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He just needed to buy himself a little time first .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the McGill released her hand , and pulled out the fortune slip with his sharp nails .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	However thinking about Bob she decided to call the hospital to see if there were any updates on him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Wil riding his bicycle so far then walking along tracks , across fields of peanuts with an expectation he was going to find temples that were untouched .
tr	NP_VP_.	Robert remembered sinking the hay hook into it deep and pulling finally , at the end of its resistance , with two hands .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But sometimes they 're lasting .
tr	OTHER	"His face red with anger , the colonel said , "" Yes , I do say so ."
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was he supposed to go up against a Great Beast ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What exactly had Eddie written ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Our time together is ringed with soft white lighting around the edges .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it wanted a taste of him .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Avril tugged on my hand .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she eat and drink ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the first time her eyes flicked up , pausing on Lavina 's for a second before staring back at the tabletop .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who could survive without one , regardless of writing ability ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there is more to life than not dying .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Not Mr. Right Now .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she looked at her watch .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	As much as she despised the thought , for the sake of her mother she knew she would eventually give in .
tr	OTHER	Not sure about the other psychic counselors .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The powers it gave me were surreal .
tr	NP_VP_.	She took out three more guards in this fashion before she was subdued by several blasts from their weapons .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" A little after six ."
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because I was pretty sure he didn 't know Aly at all .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because Bonnie knew exactly what that nudge meant .
tr	NP_VP_.	A business started by the great-grandfather nearly a hundred years ago .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now there were other bonds that tied him to her .
tr	NP_PP_.	A text from Ginny .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He also needed to get some more clothing .
tr	OTHER	Only then did he turn his attention back to Daniel .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he was forgiving her .
tr	VP_.	asked Lito once more .
tr	NP_PP_.	Weary of hearing the whispers about his mother and father .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we are very selective .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he took off the shoes and socks .
tr	OTHER	Valerie had been making real progress , she knew it , but Beth had been standing in the way .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She then got up and bustled round the stove .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he had a right to use a stun gun when she ran .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like my body was being animated by some mindless creature , for certainly my soul was gone .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I really think Nix checked the security tape of our building whenever he was away , which was usually most of the time ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon the world will bow before them and she cannot wait for it .
tr	NP_VP_.	I chuckled and willed all thoughts to a whisper , low enough so that I couldn 't make anything out of it .
tr	VP_.	Don 't go giving me visions of him in any kind of tights .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But we were more friends than anything else for most of that time .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now they were putting on the lights .
tr	S_VP_.	Marriage and having kids was one of the things I sacrificed in the service of my country .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I noticed that the whole thing read like a journal entry , rather than a letter to someone else .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the coming battle might just prove to be his last .
tr	S_VP_.	Having children will do that .
tr	S_VP_.	Still smiling broadly he turned his head .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And here he was , raping me anyway .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I had to take my chance the moment I saw it .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now he wanted to see .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it was because she saw the look of disbelief on Arie 's face .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If there was justice he 'd be as big as the Stones .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But at least I didn 't dream of him .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What am I supposed to have done ?
tr	NP_PP_.	More weight for the book bag .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he didn 't let the fear last .
tr	S_VP_.	Focusing on getting her emotions in check before she faced the storm .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The waves had been particularly choppy on this trip and some of the passengers were not feeling up to par today .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Not when that blender is beginning to feel suspiciously like a collar .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We just set up a few strategically placed smoke blasters to add a little excitement to their lives .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Sebastian was talking with her and she asked him to call her Mia .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least that was what I was told .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he made a sincere promise to God in his prayer .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Whatever I was feeling myself was no doubt nothing compared to the sickness churning inside my friend right now .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why wouldn 't she have assumed that the hotshot immigrant gambler was looking for a way into Vegas society ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This morning she 'd awoken with a hollow pang in her chest and the stark conclusion that she was an adulteress .
tr	VP_.	said the lawyer Mr. Slant .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The last time it had backfired .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Julia smiled as I kissed her on the cheek and I shook Jake 's hand .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It only took another second for the woman to notice the change in her captive .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She wraps her arms around my waist and I look at Kira , pleading with her to answer the questions I can 't say out loud .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Whatever the reason he is there at the house by himself .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By the end of the ride everyone who was on the canoe was soaking wet .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I was determined to win .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did anyone even care how we feel ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She straddled the fence and glanced around .
tr	NP_PP_.	Here at the house .
tr	VP_.	Be thinkin ' about home again .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she leave something out -- something to give herself away ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Mostly they were morsels of little nourishment ; soldiers near death , or crippled and elderly humans too weak to move .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One moment it burned with scorching heat and the next it went cool and lifeless .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Why I had never considered it was , just now , becoming a bit of a mystery .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the fuck is wrong with him ?
tr	VP_.	""" Are you out of your mind ?"
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Reacher and Pauling pushed past the stuff on the sidewalk and squeezed through the narrow doors and looked at the dusty items inside .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just sort of spluttered .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who does this place belong to ?
tr	VP_.	Could stick out my tongue and taste it .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He wasn 't sure what she did on any given day that could be deemed a parental responsibility , save for the occasional dinner she made .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	For hours Megan stared through the hole and into the light of the world , hungry for the hope she might survive .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she reached out , found a handhold , stepped up and grabbed her mother 's hand .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it was all over for both of them .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Violet flowers she used to pick for me all the time .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she saw him standing a few hundred yards away .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This week we 're reading Room by Emma Donoghue .
tr	OTHER	Plus , they could always plead insanity and , judging from their recent and extended history , most juries would buy it .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is it with guys who can 't spell out you ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Mixing business with pleasure .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As Hugo placed the girl on her feet she swooned back in to his arms .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Wallis really had nothing to say considering he couldn 't even figure out what all the lines were .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Good thing he did .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As it emerged into the light it changed from black to blue .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Spotting a few shards of broken glass in the solution he ventured a guess .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Later that morning there came a phone call for Penny Sullivan .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It then holds the man while another takes a rip at him .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Each day they would spend several hours going through recipes Guy wanted to add to the menus and seeking the perfect wine and beverage match .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What a jolly whisky it was , but for dark nights only .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if Lauren needed protection from her own sister .
tr	OTHER	All through the morning and all through the afternoon and well into the evening .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Obviously this woman 's shitty day started long before the flat tire .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Yet there she was , making dinner .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I still haven 't regained all the weight I lost .
tr	VP_.	echoed in the empty streets .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Through the window I could see a sliver of the moon between the branches of a distant tree .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What do you want ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" The Song of Solomon ."
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But her peace of mind depended on turning this page of their past .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And all those levers and controls that , from the ground , looked so thoroughly intimidating but in reality were no problem for me at all .
tr	S_CC_S_.	That 's just under a month away and you 're still waiting on permits and inspections , anyway .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Where a nose should have been there was only two small apertures , and below them a small slit for a mouth .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she shoved the door , hoping it would give .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had happened during those few , short hours ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As Max drove further in he realized they were at an auto repair shop .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he thrust two fingers into her she gasped , her orgasm washing over her , giving him another rush of warm honey .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe his nerves were getting to him as well .
tr	NP_VP_.	I saw her near the end .
tr	VP_.	Don 't worry that you aren 't giving people what they want .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now it was up to him to make them proud .
tr	NP_VP_.	Amy said feigning surprise pleased a sheet now hid the lovers ' modesty .
tr	VP_.	Thank you for planning all of this .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then Carlisle was right there , his hand on Jasper 's arm .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What most people don 't get nowadays is that without Christians there would be no Christmas .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did she know about lovers ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If he hadn 't been weak and wanting to run away all the time he could have stopped Anna .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they wonder about you , a lot .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If only I could tell you the smallest part of it , if only I could confide and seek your guidance .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I decided to forget completely about you .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because , for her , all of this was growing a lot more serious than just like .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Never once had it even occurred to him to let her die .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Again he fought to breathe , struggling to make sense of the horror before him .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Her texts always brightened my day .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the other elemental was a woman .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That it fulfilled Hector 's own wish at the same time was an added benefit .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know that this entire building is riddled with secret passageways ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a millisecond his brain scanned for the move most likely to get her to safety .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	A year in North Dakota and Kirstie still didn 't call it home .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I nodded at Evie 's suggestion in agreement .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What were you doing on the west side of the state ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Hands are pulling me , lifting me up and I can almost feel something but not quite .
tr	VP_.	Didn 't take a genius to figure out that he wanted to change her .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he noticed the third man had his weapon out .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe they didn 't care , or doubted they had any .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where was the man who had only a week and a half ago told her he could never be bored with her ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	It was yellowed with age but it still had good color although Abbey expected that the embroidery was more even when it was first done .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What happened last night is .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If there were any other rooms like this anywhere in the world it would be enough to take the Citadel easily .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	* * * It took Paul a week of searching before he finally located her , or at least discovered where she had gone .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I do the only thing I can do to cope with it .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I raked the magnolia leaves .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps your sister will accept them .
tr	S_CC_S_.	There was a flash of blue light and the guard screamed as he flew through the air .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Will showed no sign that he was aware that I was in bed with him .
tr	NP_VP_.	He smiled and then ran on .
tr	S_VP_.	started Matthew , realizing it was no longer in his possession .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	""" What in great space ... "" he murmured , and slid a finger under the packet 's flap to tear it open ."
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Twitchy or sprouting hair in weird places ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once again , she 's dressed in the same tank and shorts she wore on Sunday .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I never expected to be a slave owner .
tr	S_VP_.	To get on with my life , as if forgetting about what he and I had been through was an easy thing to do .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they have a closet full of folks standing by ; making certain all visitors always had an escort ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much for acting cool and collected .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she know what her friend was doing at these house parties ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So it was really him .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I way too used to having people treat me with a little deference and a little extra attention because I was well-heeled and a widow ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she gave up , standing and slipping her arm around my shoulders .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Any chance you can hold it until I can get a little shut eye ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Stefan looked up with a flicker of interest .
tr	OTHER	Was there a pink glow around me when I healed Susan ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They curiously stepped out from behind the theatre as the others leapt down from the stage .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What kind of person brought a pillow to a gunfight ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	By the way , who talked about marriage ?
tr	S_VP_.	Bringing her pleasure was too easy for him .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did it even matter ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can we be shot down when we are only beginning ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	He was talking to me but he was staring at Tallis .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would a mountain lion be in this area anyhow ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then she said to Vasile , "" And you !"
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As the foot of the slide struck the tarmac there was a low pop !
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes just to get out of the cabins the men would flee to the bridge where they would talk man stuff .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Within three seconds they were at their intended destination .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I told her to hang up and call 9-1-1 .
tr	VP_.	was how the whispers all began .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I won 't hold it against her .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And you have to go with it with every fiber of your being .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The others tried not to look at one another 's faces .
tr	OTHER	But the cruiser was gaining on them and Darryl felt a sick sensation in the pit of his gut .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After Jeff 's untimely entrance last night I don 't think she 's going to open up again .
tr	OTHER	How much did he suspect ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there are the newcomers .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He heard her giggle at something the man said .
tr	S_VP_.	Just seeing him made me want to throw my arms around him and beg him to stay .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he thinking right now ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With his free hand Leo drew his dagger but at the same moment another fluffy monster bit at his already caught hand .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But most were grabbed and fired out of the valley with such force that they quickly vanished .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If anything is perfect it is a fire .
tr	OTHER	Perhaps when he was king .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did he lie to me about her ?
tr	S_VP_.	Assuming he regrets it at all .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you not hear me the last time ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then there was the moment at the car when he 'd brushed off his filthy pants and arms .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In fact it 's been a real tonic , Bill Door .
tr	VP_.	said Van Von suspiciously .
tr	S_CC_S_.	This was his entire fault and she was still angry with him for what he had done back at the fort .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the magicians began hurling challenges at me .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Not because they 're in love , but because they truly believe this moment is special , because people in power have told them so .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Not once had he treated her as if she was insignificant , like so many of the other popular guys had at first .
tr	NP_VP_.	They 'd be loaded on board first thing in the morning .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet David didn 't want to offer up anything , be it his hand or a few conciliatory words .
tr	NP_VP_.	Gnomes like cold temperatures , just like Anna said .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because I 'm your dad , and what I say goes .
tr	OTHER	' Oh yeah , sure I did .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did someone open the window on a cold New York autumn day ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Bit of a crawler ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So a small contingent of humanity could live in a valley under 24-7 surveillance ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She only believed in what she could see , taste , touch , smell , and hear .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The abundance of life there flowed free as the river .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could someone like Serenity afford to stay at the Hilton ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And he must have done a lot of commanding .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they froze as the police raised their weapons .
tr	OTHER	But I just don 't believe Jacy Rayner is the type of person to hold that kind of a grudge .
tr	VP_.	Thank you for respecting the hard work of this author .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I nodded and closed my eyes .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was he kidding ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a few steps he saw more spots like that , and some weird streaks on the walls .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By now they had conveyed the names ' Cannon & Ball ' to themselves .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Apparently his urges weren 't merely subconscious .
tr	S_CC_S_.	' Then I will go there in good time and when he comes we will catch him .
tr	VP_.	Look at what happened to Big Man Troy .
tr	OTHER	Does he really have to torture me like this ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One day I hope you 'll understand .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	The one whose entire body is tattooed with violent , bloody images no less ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you say Kendra beat you ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I woke up I was tied to a bed in some apartment with a man named Jesus .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I had committed murder he wouldn 't have freaked out that much !
tr	S_CC_S_.	If she had to she would make up odd jobs or someone might just find her asleep in a corner somewhere .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if he was reading his mind , Shane took off running down the street before Nick could grab him .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had she said ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he ask me that when I just pissed him off ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because if you do that 's a great way to keep me from ever visiting .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A lot of good it had done him .
tr	VP_.	Impressive independent co-ordination skills in Nightingale 's opinion .
tr	OTHER	We both know he 's not the man for you .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever purpose they had had was now gone .
tr	NP_VP_.	I 'm not blind .
tr	S_VP_.	Forgive me ... stay with me .
tr	NP_PP_.	My blood in his veins .
tr	S_CC_S_.	""" Only you can make my heart race and my mind soar all at the same time ."
tr	OTHER	How pitiful was that ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Julia was off to begin dinner .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One he could follow .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But you didn 't live in the movies .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell is she doing ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Looking beyond him I saw the comms room was filled floor to ceiling with racks of computer terminals , all long dead and no blinking lights .
tr	S_VP_.	Lightning sizzled once , twice , three times , slammed into the earth as thunder cracked , shaking the land with the unholy sound .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What artifacts had Ashlyn meant ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After a bite to eat they went back down to the garden shed to discuss the Talisman .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Only the most beautiful girl in Texas ."
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	That really wasn 't enough .
tr	S_CC_S_.	You 're gorgeous and women are going to ogle you .
tr	S_VP_.	Maybe getting up wouldn 't be so easy after all .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On it was a single name : Archer Finn .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time the master spoke first .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Mr Bradshaw correctly interpreted his glance at Whitlow .
tr	NP_VP_.	Paige 's words echoed in his head .
tr	VP_.	Take it , now .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At that moment his uncle seemed bigger than any giant from Alfie 's world .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once we 've overseen the administration of the first hundred thousand vaccinations we can leave the rest to the CDC .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she thinking ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For missing that rabbit so badly when she couldn 't find him .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Yet this particular decision wasn 't about Izzy .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What on earth was that about ?
tr	S_VP_.	Taking a bite of the dinner roll she immediately began to cry .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did the logbook author know where to go , and what did he think he 'd have to do when he got there ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't she run ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she Google me too ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What impossible decisions a parent had to make to protect a child .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I wander down to the graves themselves and lay the roses gently down on the freshly dug earth .
tr	VP_.	Does to me , too .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Give in and go back to the time of my life I don 't want anyone exposed to .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	No one else could create something that felt so horrible .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she leaned over and gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly someone behind us screams in Russian .
tr	OTHER	But it still jarred me to hear him talk about someone else , especially about how close he 'd been to committing to Salina forever .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The lives that were lost .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Last Bastion is at war with them ?
tr	NP_PP_.	A damn good one until now .
tr	OTHER	* That iss you .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he tell her anytime he was going to haul away one of her classmates ?
tr	OTHER	If there is anything else I can do , don 't hesitate to call .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did they shoot Jesse and not kill him ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I couldn 't tell her that .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then he paused .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How will she react ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe we won 't .
tr	S_VP_.	To sleep would mean to fall back into the dark place .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" The thirst for revenge ?"
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I remembered how they 'd brought me down here despite all the cameras in the hallway .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did all that really happen ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she extended her left hand to the pool of water and narrowed her eyes .
tr	OTHER	How modern of him .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing them together was burned into my brain forever .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just as he was certain Grizzly was the reason they hadn 't been attacked .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she going to ask ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I 'm sure he 's thinking , ' Wow .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So everyone quieted at his sharply uttered words .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I know you can 't scan over that great a distance .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For six months we thought we were in love .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Whoever did this would be exposed and punished if Isaac had to spend every dime he owned to see it happen .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the scorpions knew the area far better than the rats .
tr	OTHER	Don 't you know how to act cool ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she know I would never have come here if my brother hadn 't stolen the invitation and come here first ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Why Ava 's interest in Zeke had turned into a full-blown obsession .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Without a word I began dressing swiftly .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she want to end things ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For now I was quite obviously drawn in .
tr	VP_.	Didn 't have the heart to wake him .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Where I really wanted to be was at the studio , preparing for the next four years of dancing with and against the best .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I 'm careless and I don 't think things through and this is where it 's gotten me .
tr	VP_.	Keep an eye out .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	We accelerate again , then reach a wide , open road suspended across the railroad tracks I once walked down to reach the compound .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	You should have seen the look on Cassius ' face the first time I spoke to him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you have a mark where I hit you .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his mouth worked its way down the delicate line of her jaw to her neck .
tr	OTHER	Just in-and-out new history .
tr	NP_VP_.	Bobby looked up Murphy 's phone number that he been given that morning .
tr	S_VP_.	Trying to make Veronica doubt him ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the High Council threaten you ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Normally it was just fun and games ; an entertaining pastime to challenge her while allowing her to appease her curiosity .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I should 've said no but I can 't help myself .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who does she have in line ?
tr	VP_.	Racing into the night .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did he even use this worthless thing ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he poured a glass of whiskey and wandered into his home office .
tr	VP_.	Falling in love at every turn .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could Malcolm betray me like that ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But her eyes flutter and shut .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so Rafe found himself once more inside Adele 's tent .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell am I going to do ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He felt both martyred and heroic .
tr	VP_.	was Alice 's reply .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Even one who has just ' turned ' is very formidable .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I was still reeling inside from Georgina 's death and I desperately needed somewhere private to let out my emotions .
tr	VP_.	Try closing your eyes again .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she 'd realized in the three days since her affair with Dominic had ended that Mike 's defection had hurt her pride not her heart .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The temptation to stay and soak it up was strong .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But your spirit might let go .
tr	NP_PP_.	Another change of mood .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least he was up front , letting the truth of his intentions linger like a haunting shadow .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The titles that Victoria had written reminded him of something but he did not know what .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	My eyes frantically scanned my surroundings , desperate to be calmed by familiarity .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I always say is that once you get the whole thing out into the open , you don 't have any more trouble .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If Ranma was returning to the house it must mean that his granddaughter was still in the house .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I thought of Aiden and how much more time I 'd have for him .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could six vampires waltz into the middle of London and feed on thirty men ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Gaston really think she would be going up to his floor just to see him ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What do you want ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Reyes think him a fool , that he would give up his own life in exchange for that of his youngest whelp ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But at once everything stopped .
tr	OTHER	Even if Lucas was dumb enough to bet against him .
tr	NP_VP_.	Her arms and legs wrapped around him , not just holding him captive but surrounding him with all that she was .
tr	NP_VP_.	The gate keeper recognized trouble when he saw it , or , in this case , when he got screamed at .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Ginger certainly thought it was her .
tr	OTHER	But based on what he had just read , perhaps it was the wiser choice .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Ares was carrying Raquel on his mighty shoulders and she leaned down to laugh into his ear .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it was done .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They too were destroyed .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He cupped her chin in his hand and stared into the complex eyes of the woman he adored .
tr	OTHER	Middle finger , straight .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Standing upright again she slapped his arm playful as she was wont and teased him back .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Pretend like nothing happened ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She reached down and pulled at his shoulders , urging him up .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	An apartment she wouldn 't have if it wasn 't for Oliver , her conscience pointed out .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we set off in sensible shoes , Stephen in the lead , the scoutmaster .
tr	S_VP_.	Watching it made Lily sick .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Until she wanted him with every cell in her body and she would do anything to keep him .
tr	VP_.	Let 's all retire to the library for brandy .
tr	NP_VP_.	Another second and the boy with the gun darted from the alley and , for some reason , ran straight in their direction .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One by one the guests gave up on her .
tr	NP_PP_.	Dad stares inside the refrigerator .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Why vampires were attracted to me was a mystery .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you said that you were aware of your eventual objective .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A day that would have filled her with such happiness .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you can 't tell anybody this .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Occasionally an employee will pass us , wearing a T-shirt that says , In My Life , I Love The Mall .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least Lola and I managed to keep our romantic interests separate from professional business .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Her friends no longer cared .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When night falls I will go to the street .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She also had the name of a young Roman who had come to her Italian class in New York .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The loamy ground cushioned the boy 's fall and he rolled quickly and with some trepidation to see the outcome of his action .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she exploded on a scream , her orgasm taking over , pulling her up , up , and over .
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting back Stu asked how he 'd got on at poker the previous night .
tr	NP_PP_.	A sense of loss .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the poet showed no such inhibition .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you ever see passports all alone in a drawer ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I softly put my hands on the glass making sure my eyes didn 't deceive me and the reflection I caught was reality .
tr	OTHER	But Aiden wasn 't a prince and I wasn 't Cinderella .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They more or less bobbed and swayed with the group until a line dance started .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I felt a thrill of anticipation run through me and an image of him spanking me while bent over his desk arose in my mind .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I closed my eyes and pulled the trigger .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He returned to the small table and removed a capsule from the probe he used .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last year I would have thrown my hands up and walked away .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We all embraced in a group hug and just as we let go the guys walked in with alcohol .
tr	S_VP_.	Analyzing both factors to his dream from an outside perspective seems really ridiculous .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Josephine recognized this category six as Brenda Kirkland from the picture in the history books she 'd read .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Pizza and pasta , some of the best spaghetti in town , without all the fuss and ceremony that Nino so fondly dispensed at Montana 's .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just as I knew you 'd be .
tr	NP_VP_.	I had my arms stuffed with fishnet stockings , knee-high black boots , and an Olivia Outcast purse .
tr	S_VP_.	Seemed to Joe for some reason those people who needed help got a benefit from suffering while he lost .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that seems to settle it .
tr	OTHER	Was this some sort of ploy to gain attention ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then her dad would probably pull her from Shadow Falls .
tr	VP_.	""" What about you ?"
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	13 Haven 's first day back at George Walker High School started terribly .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She 'd promised herself she wouldn 't be confrontational .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One morning Colt went out to work somewhere on the ranch .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Kane : Why did he want to go to war ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Finding nothing he popped the trunk and leaned over the back seat looking for the money and drugs .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She still practises medicine .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really have an aversion to blonde women ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he broke the spell by dropping his hands and taking a step back I had to blink several times to clear the fog .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe G.G. was spicing up the story a bit .
tr	VP_.	Strode to the door .
tr	S_VP_.	Touched a heart he had thought was long dead .
tr	VP_.	says Cara , narrowing her eyes .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the senator pay you to find out what I was ?
tr	S_VP_.	Suppressing them was easier than reliving them .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I didn 't care .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And all at once he had an idea .
tr	OTHER	A guy who could kill with the energy of pure fear .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did all vampires have money running out their ears ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I mentioned she also loved Star Trek : The Next Generation ?
tr	VP_.	Pursue a simple life upon the land and strive the Ways of God to understand .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I however feel at ease , because of my faith in magnanimity of readers .
tr	NP_VP_.	He robbed her of every protest .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do I know this life is what you want ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I wish you would 've told me you applied .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was she ever going to be taken seriously if he kept derailing all her attempts at complete independence ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He violently shook free from her grasp , gulping air as he shrieked .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Maybe Ryan really is the person I should be investigating .
tr	NP_PP_.	His closeness to her .
tr	NP_PP_.	Luster of marble and velvet .
tr	VP_.	"Let me show you what I 've found whilst you were playing ' sleeping beauty "" ' joked Beppe ."
tr	OTHER	Isn 't this where my life is supposed to flash before my eyes ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I watch him to see if he notices Miriam at my side .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He reached for the log but it slipped away and headed out across the lake .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because I have the right to cut down every tree in this forest does not mean that I should .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe someone I walked by when I came in .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I glance back and I see Diane and Blake 's eye colours glowing red and yellow , scowling at me , fury burning in them .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her breaths sounded wet and labored and I stole a moment away from the embrace to look at her .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then we just started to hang .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I took matters into my own hands and did them for you .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the millionth time he wanted to tear her father apart for the way he 'd hurt his beautiful daughter .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When a crisis arises they bring with them an abundance of comfort food , wisdom , sage advice and martinis .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	"When I heard about the Bigfoot sightings ... "" I sighed and turned back the way we 'd come ."
tr	VP_.	Wouldn 't be right .
tr	OTHER	What if Misty tried to strike out on her own before she could get back ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Jase stopped for a minute .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But obviously she 'd seen enough to out his strange taste in belts .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"When I got the news it just ... "" he shook his head , "" ... scared the hell out of me ."
tr	S_CC_S_.	She felt the pressure inside her release and her legs began to go weak .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Three of them are gathered in a group , laughing and joking about something I can 't hear .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she didn 't bring up the subject of another consulting assignment .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	The more she climbed that ladder , the more power she wanted .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If the others hadn 't been so serious she would have laughed in their faces .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she had never been truthful with him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	To the south I saw a column of incoming vehicles .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only her seat belt kept her in place .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His hand rested easily on his sword and his eyes continually moved around their area as they moved .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why am I doing this ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he actually wink at her back there ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At this close range my hull would definitely breach without proper shielding .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And your apology is not accepted .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't I put on a smile and at least attempt to fake happiness ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Not one he 'd shared with his older sibling .
tr	OTHER	How proud Vivian was of him .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I moved to walk around him but he blocked my path .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she did what she had to do .
tr	VP_.	Go away and take your accusations with you .
tr	VP_.	Had never even considered before .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She just wanted something to make the pain go away .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Off balance he opened up his body as he struck his shot , slicing right across the line of his intended target .
tr	NP_PP_.	First of all , to find out what Sullivan wanted .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He favored me with the kind of expression most people reserve for idiot children .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I give a rat 's ass ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	DAY The husband and wife still have the man-sized mosquitos attached and sucking blood .
tr	NP_PP_.	A tap on the shoulder .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even in the muted light it was obvious her glorious golden eyes were flashing with fury .
tr	NP_PP_.	A full-blooded one who isn 't ashamed of what my kind does .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Instead of going directly to the table I make my way to the cafeteria line .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I followed blindly .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly a bar stool flew through the air , knocking the guy in the red tee sideways .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she leaned down , bringing her slightly blue lips only a few inches from Kylie 's face .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The university eventually called the police , who had no idea what to do .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We all chuckled and agreed .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are you here instead of that pile of mates I have ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	When we reach my mom 's car parked in the driveway , we climb in and I start the engine .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At that moment George returned and saw the tears in his grandmother 's eyes .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where were the assassin wolves when he needed them ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The draperies were tied with golden tasseled ropes .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he was scared to make a move as long as John remained across the parking lot from him .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And they had heard every word .
tr	S_VP_.	Shaking his head frequently as the tip of Jane 's pencil moved from one line item to another .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Devlin didn 't leave .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she 'd woken alone .
tr	NP_VP_.	Frank was happier than he had ever been .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he just make a joke ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I could tell by the tone of her voice our discussion was over .
tr	OTHER	But one day Tim left home and Daisy wondered how her mom and dad could still love him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Not after seeing what some of the kids at Mythos could do .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there 's this plane .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he satisfy her and not take pleasure himself ?
tr	OTHER	But then I feel his hand on top of mine and the connection causes my eyelids to lift .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I was still keenly aware of the throbbing in my arm and my throat was parched for blood .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As time passes memories are formed in the brain .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And his monsters could get him on and off without notice .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Each time he spoke she thought about landing her fist in his face .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he plan on marrying her and going off with another woman when the mood struck him ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But sometimes she could be as contrary as Pa. .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	"Moments later all hands were slapped together with shouts of "" Winners "" being shouted for all to hear ."
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had I wanted to save them ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely Momma knew Daddy wouldn 't just be leaving it at that .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Apparently he gave the woman a good talking to .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Jump or swerve I can 't get through them .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Unless he came from one of their Gulag Colonies .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And there came the fierce blast of a bullhorn demanding caution .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	These days I didn 't have much interest in sex .
tr	NP_VP_.	I rose up and snatched the wide knife from the dead footman 's palm .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Monk felt no shame as tears rolled heavily and he rocked Pyotr one last time , now just an empty shell of a boy .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely they wouldn 't fight here , in the restaurant .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What have you been doing ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But inside she stopped astonished in the entrance .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Another surge passed by and the dinghy crashed against Teleport 's aft section .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell happened today ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did he go out of his way not to hurt me ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That way I can better blend in with those who live here .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now she is the only one who may set you free , if you can find her .
tr	NP_PP_.	Some of the euphoria that came from drugs .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it shuffled into the light , roaring as it came towards them .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I hadn 't intervened when I did then your Uncle Davis would either be dead or badly hurt .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The scientist always kept telling him that soon he would make use of his unique abilities , but that soon seemed rather distant .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Near the theatre there are usually people out late .
tr	NP_VP_.	You don 't want to meet at a reasonable time to get started .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Tony still lurked about but Garcia was already gone .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What his daughter said made sense .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely it was the middle of the daylight hours when they arrived ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Beside her stood Wilhelm Schell , speaking to the bartender before noticing the new arrival .
tr	OTHER	Didn 't that ever occur to you ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	To find the mirror and the key thou must seek the casket .
tr	NP_PP_.	A real snob with no personality .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When they had entered the colonel shot the locking iron bolt and stood with his back to the door .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We never practised it .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way he moves .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he stopped and appeared to be searching for the right words .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I wished I could call him , to hear his voice so that the nice feelings could return and I wouldn 't have to be so paranoid .
tr	NP_PP_.	Electrical impulses in the brain .
tr	OTHER	On the left was one of two elevators on the floor .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I truly convinced that she would scoff at my well-intentioned concern ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Even though he might have been .
tr	NP_VP_.	He found her lounging by a sparkling blue pool , soaking up the sun .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She was starting to consume my every thought and I prayed to God that I consumed hers .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When will she change back ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did he know that ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why were they acting as if it was an emergency ?
tr	VP_.	Reminding me that he was the gatekeeper of my ecstasy .
tr	VP_.	Tell everyone I 'm sorry .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Something inside me snapped and I shoved the line cook , causing him to pitch forward .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The other four Traders silently got up and walked over to the fifth Trader , guiltily avoiding Sally 's horrified gaze .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he had bitten her and drawn blood .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she not know that our lives were in danger ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What has happened over the past 2 decades will be as if it never happened .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How on earth would Patch ever get in ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'd have to backtrack and try to find another way through the maze of stone .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The same way she 'd felt seeing him and that girl at the party .
tr	NP_VP_.	He leaned back against the expensive looking shiny wood and crossed his arms over his chest .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she carries the rock back down to the beach where the man is lying mostly still .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	However the voice recognition software would quite often misinterpret what a doctor dictated .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she 'd tucked it away and forgotten about it .
tr	VP_.	Waited a few minutes as he gathered his thoughts .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Their new home stood beside the lake and she could see almost right the way across it from her kitchen window .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just wish that I knew how I summon it .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you were keeping track of that , too .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it too much to ask for the same thing with Nate ?
tr	VP_.	Wore no expression at all as he stabbed his daughter in the stomach .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he lit another cigarette .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He 'd chase Ben out of here and we 'd all be together again , just like we was once before .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By now he knows we have Flaherty and he knows we have Kate and the girls back .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it was Frankie 's turn to scowl .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever had killed Krause and his crew were gone .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"If she told you ... "" Aria took a breath , trying not to burst into tears ."
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I even supposed to be at home ?
tr	S_VP_.	To see her husband again under such circumstances would be the worse humiliation .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because she always makes things seem ten times better .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If we can talk to you over drinks it 'll be better .
tr	NP_VP_.	she cried , hanging out the window in the back seat .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you see that ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Seconds later her mother touched her with shaking hands as she brought her palms down either side of the tray .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	In a Fallen life you grow up very fast , or at least I did .
tr	VP_.	Needed her to hear it .
tr	OTHER	But it also forced me to grit my teeth and assure him that the pain was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Sal immediately stood up when he saw Brett .
tr	S_VP_.	Being with me was what his parents feared .
tr	NP_VP_.	A scream came from behind me , and then another .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why do you think I warned Terra about you before I went off to South Figaro that time ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	For them to take the stage means this is not going to be good .
tr	VP_.	asked the pilgrim of death .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she see it ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did a wolf mate with a human ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I got down there he put an arm around me and squeezed .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the story about the professor 's death had broken .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because I was weak I left my baby girl to bury her momma .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And about five minutes ago we should have been able to see the lights of Denver clearly from the airplane .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I thought it was just the physical demands of powering through the horrible jungle and my muscles were just shaking .
tr	NP_VP_.	Something had fallen into place with an almost audible click .
tr	VP_.	Take me with you to see Brightman .
tr	VP_.	Made up some story that she wanted to see him about Randy .
tr	OTHER	The best thing we can do right now , is not forget who we are .
tr	S_VP_.	Getting the emerald had been a bad idea .
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting opposite Miles on a cream colored divan was an older couple .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So his offer was a godsend .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I know she forgives me , just as I forgive her .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now she knew how she 'd made him feel .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But look at this : By turning it around , all four component twigs are quickly found , but never all at once .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would they when they would have to be subjected to blood tests and physicals ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I find nothing and the only thing left is the underside of the bed I hesitate .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I have ever hurt her ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Feelings that were growing beyond anything he 'd anticipated or knew how to deal with .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If Caleb was here then only bad things could follow .
tr	OTHER	Is it because it wasn 't going to be a black tie affair in a room full of photographers ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What Pendleton had the tattoo artist inscribe was Katherine Atherton McClellan Pendleton .
tr	VP_.	Rocking back and forth .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the fever started .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	5 It was weird and quiet and spooky .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least they can become aware of our leaving tungsten for them to pick up , for instance .
tr	S_VP_.	To Nate the blotches were alive and grabbing at him .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And her father was standing right there , which helped a great deal with the old self-control .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he hadn 't always been the uncompromising player he was now .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Her moments of mild flirtation always took Michael aback .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell was all of that anyway ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Elec approached also , sipping an elixir , then removing his sword from its scabbard .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many people had wanted to share in the couple 's happiness .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then you 're about five hours ahead of us .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I told Martin about Jimmy and Susu , and Jimmy 's little quirk .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At once she moved to merge with Skyler .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What he 'd once thought they could be for real .
tr	NP_PP_.	A song with no words and no real melody .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I wasn 't suppose to know .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it wouldn 't be fair to him .
tr	S_VP_.	Having it come back as wolf would be a pain in the ass , and would raise more questions than it answered .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She thought she heard a smile in his voice but she didn 't think this was a laughing matter .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Clearly we did not share an interest in food .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Over the painting in elaborate silver scroll were the Ten Commandments .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean I had to run until the end of P.E. ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	She said she can bring up your cousins and we can have a nice party .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she had showed up in Saudi as part of the long , ponderous Desert Shield buildup .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he reached for her and they were holding each other .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he gave Kateri the simplest explanation .
tr	S_VP_.	Knowing she is touching me intimately gives me the courage to do the same .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now he was getting ready to leave her .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he like the short skirt and string tops that girls normally wore to clubs ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was the point in worrying ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	His hand went to my panties and he grabbed the material at my core and ripped them away .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But at least she 'd learned Stinky would not taste very good .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I win against such powerful telekinesis ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As soon as I took my seat , my cell buzzed and I looked at it as everyone settled in .
tr	NP_VP_.	The two of them spend all day in a tree .
tr	NP_PP_.	A dark streak down its back .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Next they heard the beat of its wings fade into the distance .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had he never thought to bring her to places like this before ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Jason was pleased to find the soil and climate was agreeable for growing a sustainable variety of vegetables .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At first she 'd been angry with him .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would Kelsey say ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But they were pretty upset now .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they feel Patch had somehow tricked them ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	So in order to avoid this odious punishment he had started jogging to the garden so he could spend a few more minutes there before heading home .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you think that if she left me I would come crawling to you ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	They were his law partners and the three of them were now standing in a skybox about thirty feet above us .
tr	NP_VP_.	Alex turned and looked at Lauren .
tr	S_VP_.	Sighing she pressed the talk button .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I wouldn 't belong to him .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But you don 't get the girl until you 've gotten the girl .
tr	NP_VP_.	We smiled at her thoughtfulness .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did his spirit rise into the light , were all things clear finally , and forgiven ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He certainly didn 't understand what she had to be embarrassed about .
tr	VP_.	Look around the door .
tr	OTHER	Although immigration probably wouldn 't like it much .
tr	S_VP_.	Included with this memo is security footage of the incident .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What we did not know is that while we were in Phnom Penh , the entire countryside near our home had been mined .
tr	NP_VP_.	He was over a head taller than his companion , and wielded a hammer of unimaginable power .
tr	NP_VP_.	Officer Stanley asked again with a puzzled look .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I think she would have a notion of where she was or , more importantly , who I was ?
tr	S_VP_.	Trying to even get to her level was impossible .
tr	NP_VP_.	Kenzie looked pale , hesitating at the door , where a man 's furious voice could be heard beyond the wood .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he sat down , reluctantly licking the cherry and parsnip delight off his paws , and waited .
tr	OTHER	Or maybe my canoe shows up at the end of his dock .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Had they died and were on their way to another world ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Another slap in the face , another silent response .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Thor barely stopped to catch his breath as he sped down the hills , through the trees , scratched by branches and not caring .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now she laced her arms around his neck .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She pushed aside the sheet , got to her feet and crossed the room to the small carry-on bag she had brought with her .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Everything about this night feels good .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a long moment he stared , as did she , at the spellbinding sight of the water pouring down into the pool .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they have mortals they loved and stopped in to see every few years ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Not the kind of sound that would invoke calm in most people .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's going on between you two ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Before her mother demanded she sever even that relationship .
tr	S_VP_.	Reading by the dull moonlight that streamed in from the porch was impossible .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet she saw none of that now .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I refused to get jealous over Jason having dated Amanda .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Sunday 19th June 1983 Danny woke the next morning clear headed .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he had feared most had come true .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he dream ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do they know Echo ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she told him why he had to leave there was the anticipated refusal .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Either way you will serve her .
tr	VP_.	Remember that we might be watched .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Bloody hell that 's cold .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Actually any pleasure in the physical aspects of their marriage had died months earlier , when Tom had demanded she have an abortion .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And again we met .
tr	OTHER	""" Joey , what 's going on ?"
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How the man on his way to work had ended up as the social misfit was never fully explained to him .
tr	VP_.	said Viktor , throwing on his black hood .
tr	S_VP_.	To broach the subject at all will be a risk .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he so bored that he could find nothing better to do than make a nuisance of himself inside his own organization ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever bats lived here were probably out feeding .
tr	VP_.	Try 'em out then pick one and stick with it .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we made a deal .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What we don 't have experience to draw on is the taking of a child followed by bulletins of reassurance .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because I 'll tell you ' t is a rotten thing to do after I live .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I don 't want to give in to him .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why should she choose this backwater ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a few minutes she returned .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He also wore a pedant around his neck and there were probably six wands stashed in an inner pocket of his pants .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he have anything solid ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Plus you will have to pay any and all applicable shipping costs .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Just then Steve noticed Carol 's physician , Dr. Stewart , push open the swinging door and walk toward the waiting area .
tr	NP_VP_.	He knew it would only piss her off .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like a tube of lipstick that wasn 't really one .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Her tears came faster and Sarah could only blink back her own .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he sounded a little hesitant .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I tell him the truth ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He 'd typed her number into his phone so he knew it was her the moment she called him .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But at least there should be no snow .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And definitely nobody is more motivated .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she ever understand how much you loved her ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The stench of stale sweat hung in the sticky air , clinging to everything its vileness could touch .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I am going to paint my masterpiece then I want to look the part .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that night Toby would tell Jake that it was a relief to get back to duty .
tr	S_VP_.	Crawling around in the dust of the old bowling alley all day had left its residue all over him .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you buy a corporation in the Caymans or somewhere in Europe .
tr	OTHER	Minutes to hours to days .
tr	OTHER	Not a goddamn proposal .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I stretch out next to him and he wraps the blanket around us both .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The colour of her eyes he couldn 't see .
tr	OTHER	And she really liked kissing Cameron .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Micha ruins it .
tr	NP_VP_.	Erin sensed he was too deeply into painting her black to even see there could be other colours .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once he has the art on the floor he uses the specialized wipes provided with the kit to remove the powder .
tr	NP_PP_.	Perhaps the most important one for many , many years .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	""" The last time I was here , "" he explained "" ' t was eight years ago , when I worked with the architects ."
tr	OTHER	Only after several moments did he look up .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It was too much to hope that the solitary guard would be delinquent and he would be able to pass by unnoticed .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Matthew gently unfolded it and beheld an ancient writing he clearly recognized around the flowers .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could they have missed it ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On two walls were huge paintings depicting the Corridor , or bullfight , by an artist I did not recognize .
tr	OTHER	So neither of us said anything and we continued to eat in silence .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was the first thing she should say to her soon to be husband ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the fact that Cain had held her in place for Ronan to subdue was not going to sit well with her .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who would have known you apes would take it up ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Still he wondered : Why the despair ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a time he lay looking up at the stars , brilliant in the desert night .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she was still playing the innocence card .
tr	VP_.	came Helen 's voice from what seemed like a long way away .
tr	S_VP_.	Thinking she was dead , gone forever .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they think I was going to fall apart just by talking to a person connected with my ex ?
tr	OTHER	How bad was it that she recognized his laugh already ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe he 's been talking the whole time .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who was she going to hunt first , and after that ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Sarah was still fuming ten minutes later when she heard the sound of Tony 's heavy boots on the main stairs .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After disconnecting the call Perez frowned at the shadow that materialized behind him .
tr	S_CC_S_.	You 've been here nearly your entire life and the ARC hasn 't caved in yet .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why move here after all these years ?
tr	OTHER	He knows we 're on holo , she thought , and I 've ruined his act .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Up ahead something else moved .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now the guy looked ready to snap , his arm trembling , the gun wavering so damned near Kathleen , the trigger finger flexing - No .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I began organizing piles onto the bed , finding invoices and payment stubs .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Recalled a night he 'd spent forty feet up in a pine tree .
tr	VP_.	Sets it on the desk behind him without turning around .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many questions sat on the tip of her tongue .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment Meyer wondered if they were perhaps afraid of the huge number of men they had in the line .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Caleb was always quick to point out I had no room to complain since I 'd brought it on myself .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He was more of a hindrance then a help and he now wished that he had stayed on the Crux .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Tomorrow I would find out about Carol .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We all shriek in terror as we plummet downwards .
tr	VP_.	Below the mounted stick of flame , an inconspicuous wall , identical to every other in this unwelcoming setting .
tr	NP_VP_.	It seems to hold .
tr	S_CC_S_.	IBM ' rs and local business people mixed with musicians and artists .
tr	NP_PP_.	The end of hope ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly the image of the ceiling pressing down and sagging under the weight of all that soil flashed into my mind .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe there 's time to dirty it up .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then a figure stepped into the light streaming from the house , a shadow falling over me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he wasn 't sure of the time like he was the other two times .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When they were safely out of earshot he turned to me .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I was heading for the door .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From the corner of his eye he saw her smile .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So they don ´ t get along much and that ´ s probably a good thing , for us .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he laid his body down on top of mine , wrapped my legs around his waist , and slid into me with one smooth motion .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Earth to Evie !"
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If your life is in jeopardy don 't hesitate .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Brayden started to fuss and I handed him back to Julia .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The light quickly grew brighter .
tr	OTHER	Only twice did they see any signs of life .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Seeming amused by the idea he shook his head slowly .
tr	OTHER	"Whenever he says "" I 'm sorry , "" she tells him it is not his fault ."
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the details are worn .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All this time I had believed that I was alone , that I was wandering through this life on my own .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now it was just me and Missile all day .
tr	S_CC_S_.	There was a knock on the door and a couple of women came in , carrying cleaning supplies .
tr	NP_VP_.	It was at that point that I noticed my lace ballet flats were ripped .
tr	S_VP_.	To marry a mortal is forbidden .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever you chased away is back !
tr	S_CC_S_.	This island was clearly special to him and he 'd chosen to bring her here .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I wanted was for someone to turn the color and smells and volume down .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He would ease his way into her mouth the way he 'd done with others .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Here I was , with a surplus of something that he obviously ached for .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she let go and moved off into the darkness .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even I knew this was serious .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he said his name Verne realized he was German and could detect a strong hint of his accent .
tr	NP_VP_.	Quincy rambled seventy-eight yards for a touchdown .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He said , with such fire in his eyes I thought he 'd explode .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he looked out to sea pensively again for a moment .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Both of you ."
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know what I was thinking ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he did something very confusing .
tr	NP_PP_.	A year at the most .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she begin to guess his secret ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	From behind him , what could only be described as a Fighting Irishman grabbed him by the scruff of his collar .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only my brother would bring six hundred pages of nonfiction with him on a trip .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I always measured his food so he doesn 't eat too much .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But somehow the prospect wasn 't as intimidating as it had been when Jason had broached the subject earlier .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For about seven minutes the entire ICS lost its collective cool .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At such quiet times her very presence was soothing .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He forgot everything and focused solely on the way he felt with Bree in his arms .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the waking life faded into the darkness of a deep and luring dream .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Jack finally broke the silence .
tr	OTHER	( pause ) The Doctor !
tr	S_CC_S_.	The dark circles on Henry 's face lightened and his arm stopped shaking .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she looked about the empty hil side , suddenly nervous .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Still he watches me .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Talk to her ?"
tr	VP_.	Let me know what time you 're getting back .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I spoke slowly , scared to know the answer yet I had to .
tr	NP_VP_.	Her eyes grew huge with shock .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he licked his lips .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the silver cufflinks that I have seen him wear a hundred times .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Being a perfect gentleman Michael smiled and said hello .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Finally we ran out of ideas .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he love this sweet beautiful woman who provided the only calming influence in his life ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever it controlled hired out for service and gave the contractor a gourd full of water .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I was a baby she saw that I would turn into a wolf .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	A few minutes later Josephine reappeared with a couple of blankets and a few rudimentary items for Richard 's new room .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He very seldom was carefree and seeing him so tonight was enjoyable , even to me .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Hawk took another sip of his wine and his senses came fully alert .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time they were much closer .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So little time left !
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Well that was a huge step forward .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there were things such as spare bulbs , candles , flashlights , and batteries .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	he asked , loving her fierce reaction and the way she demanded her pleasure .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if she were the one who had stayed and tried to fight the Lu with nothing more than a sword .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Saturday I have a dance competition .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who am I to say that I know better than my parents ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For a brief moment panic set it as she started analyzing what they were doing .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The difference today is that they all wore skeleton mask to protect their identities like they were some real life superheroes or something Dre guessed .
tr	S_VP_.	said the man , blinking his eyes at her in obviously faked ignorance .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He was agitated and constantly looking over his shoulder .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I flick the lights on and he follows me in .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like the second morning he didn 't know what a spoon was for .
tr	S_VP_.	Enough to make me wonder if my wards would be enough to stop her if she decided to come through them .
tr	S_CC_S_.	You are speaking to me telepathically and you are experiencing my personal frequency , my realm vibration .
tr	S_VP_.	Feeling the difference inside her was breathtaking .
tr	NP_PP_.	queried Bas in a whisper .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	How they had ever made it was a mystery .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Three years ago he came back .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I said my goodbye and left Jim to play the game on his own .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Somehow she remained unconvinced .
tr	NP_VP_.	They were listening with interest .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The number of minutes it would have taken for me to run back into the cabin and grab her helmet .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	she asks , her voice telling me she 's not convinced .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he asking me out to ease his conscious ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Claudine dresses for attention .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	This tells me you have something else on your mind .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had it happened in the first place ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They just couldn 't let go of them .
tr	NP_PP_.	Two swords of black steel .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did he have to do that for ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	That wasn 't what she had climbed up here to see , however .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The car was going to be a total loss and it broke a little piece of my heart .
tr	OTHER	Or rather his lack of one .
tr	S_VP_.	Stepping down is the only way to spoil her plans .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A pretense he was trying to lead her in one direction so she would bolt in toward the opposite .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is this place ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I used a camera .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How else could he begin to understand her ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If there is only you in it there will never be an answer , only questions .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In this one was about schizophrenia .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As Jesse listened his heart surged quietly .
tr	S_VP_.	Being a vampire changed the rules .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And suddenly I hoped she was a patient so that when he left , she couldn 't possibly go with him .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	To have everything you need to get by , how simple life would be with no drama .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he ask her that ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	She sighed and rolled her eyes and I leaned down farther to press my lips to hers .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They just didn 't have to carry around the various cameras , camcorders , binoculars , and other necessary stakeout items that she did .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before her sat an elegantly carved wooden table .
tr	VP_.	Tell him I 'm not his son .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	My hand partially recoiled , panic rushing through me .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then Romy grabbed his arm .
tr	OTHER	Such experiences , he held , lead first to despair and eventually to religious revelation and faith .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	""" Look , all I was doing was telling her I would pull babysitting duties ."
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Claire merely rolled her eyes .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I do , rambling about the significance of the attack .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who here would know her name except someone who knew Nate , too ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Mach and Lennox have been fighting hard at a speed no human can move .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And she was pretty darn sure that everyone was automatically assuming she 'd been partying too hard last night to show up for her own video shoot .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once I started I couldn 't stop .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Paris hold something against me ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What can I do for you ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	' Our scale of fees - ' The payment will be three million dollars .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Logan 's eyes were serious but there was a glint of a smile in them .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That I 'm on leave from my job as long as necessary .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you had better get used to the idea .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On the subway ride uptown Clary found herself unable to sit down .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The mouth you cut in with square or jagged teeth .
tr	NP_PP_.	All four of us , if you want to bring Leonard .
tr	NP_PP_.	A knock at the door .
tr	S_VP_.	Waking up alone and hurting everywhere didn 't even come close to the torment I 'd felt when I was convinced that she 'd chosen him .
tr	NP_VP_.	Beth shook her head and the Hammer nodded .
tr	NP_VP_.	Doctor says she needs to be woken up every hour .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it hits me .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As if gravity has been lost or changed somehow .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even to me my voice sounded foreign and twisted , as if I were only beginning to learn how to form words .
tr	VP_.	Waiting for me to ask .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In his hand he held the familiar leather file .
tr	NP_VP_.	I didn 't have time to sit by the side of the road .
tr	S_CC_S_.	You like this guy too much and he 's going to break your heart .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"If you wish to make this adversarial ... "" The admiral smiled ."
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I really liked her .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it my place to tell Barbie that she was all wrong , that such things weren 't possible ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Nearly every time I attempted this I saw or imagined the figure .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she wasn 't foolish enough to try to lie to herself about it , either .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The moment I heard the cries of the tiny , gooey baby in Jared 's arms , nothing else mattered .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today the promise of channeling their feelings into a night of shared passion and intimacy threatened to devour him .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did he not see this side of her when they were together ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was the point ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Jackie again led the way , having passed the lounge area on the way to the workroom .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because nothing makes sense .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who cared if she was known as an immoral , heartless slut ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When are you setting sail ?
tr	VP_.	Go ahead and have my sloppy seconds .
tr	NP_VP_.	His lips caressed mine one last time , reluctant to stop .
tr	S_VP_.	Talking to him had been more of a pleasure than I 'd expected it to be .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Chapter Eighteen So how does one hide a crossbow in plain site ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If only Alaina were more like Sakura , then James knew he 'd die a happy man .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Some sides were boarded up and the roof was made of what appeared to be wooden slats .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Seems she was overwrought after the scandal sheets were delivered .
tr	NP_VP_.	Jess grinned , ' He 's still mean , but he 's coming around .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	An icy finger whispered down his spine at the same moment he was filled with an intense , unsettling hunger .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could one girl have so effectively tied me up in knots ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Most often they became trigger-happy .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As he had no experience to draw from I didn 't think he would be able to form an opinion on the state of my fridge .
tr	NP_PP_.	Forty years in this place ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knows what the others are capable of ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	After they made love .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't he have been the host to a useful wizard like a Digger mage ?
tr	S_VP_.	To watch her eyes go soft while he kissed the corner of her mouth .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She 'd just about made her mind up the lady was lost or perhaps confusing her with someone else .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I didn 't care .
tr	S_VP_.	Lying on the quilt was the blindfold Sebastian had originally left for me in the hotel several months ago .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It just blurred his vision .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It 's supposed to be the city 's most notable landmark but it 's never impressed me very much .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was that supposed to fluster me ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course Christopher had no idea what it meant to me .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did she always warn me against dangers that were so obvious ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Or are you going to stand there and talk until the guardians return and crush your bones to powder ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he was left alone to think about what he 'd done .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she said next caught me completely by surprise .
tr	S_VP_.	Whispering your solemn secrets to a bunch of faceless voyeurs .
tr	OTHER	So what brings you here ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it was Alexia 's turn to be amused .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What happened to the geologists ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe I hadn 't been in love with him for a long time .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he 's not running for office !
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Raising a teenager wasn 't easy .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	""" Lord Morin to see you , your Majesty "" ' the guard outside the door announced ."
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What had gotten into me , that I was suddenly so comfortable , so brave , around him ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	He urged her mouth open and when she slowly parted her lips for him he muttered something thick and sensual .
tr	NP_VP_.	The first word through her lips was a name , somewhere between a question and a whisper of recognition .
tr	VP_.	To watch while society 's refuge methodically destroy their lives while my family rebuilds theirs without me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We simultaneously looked over to where Ethan , half naked , was toeing off black leather loafers .
tr	NP_VP_.	That in itself was a learning experience .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Not something I was happy to admit , nevertheless true .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he just seriously say that ?
tr	VP_.	Don 't forget that .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really believe he could get away with coming after her ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A sign he was at ease .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What am I supposed to do now ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With a petulant sniff she reflected that her nose was probably red .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For one brief instant he thought he might pass out cold .
tr	NP_VP_.	I 'm also military , which means I get a crap ton of immunizations .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least she wasn 't losing her mind .
tr	NP_PP_.	One thing at a time .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now he was too strong .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this was the stranger whose proposal she 'd have to accept before the end of the ball .
tr	OTHER	To the Roman spas .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last fall we sparred together at the gym .
tr	NP_PP_.	Always in my heart .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He now knew better than ever what the Flare did to people .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The kind of connection he craved terrified her .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How in the world did Bern miss all this in the background check ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Show him the thing he made .
tr	NP_VP_.	Her hormones had been on overdrive since her fourth month of pregnancy .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Which explanation sounded more plausible ?
tr	VP_.	Do not raise your hopes though .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could this be the first time he had seen this ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they give into our deepest natural inclinations and reach out for one another ?
tr	NP_VP_.	Her eyes were determined .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whether this was due to natural selection or genetic drift was never made clear .
tr	NP_VP_.	Cal shook his head again .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Herr 'D on said , slapping him on the back .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he shoved his hands into his pockets and stared down at his shoes as Dr. Barton walked over to a long desk with a Formica countertop .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Jay had asked if I was Wyatt 's girlfriend and we 'd all laughed as if that was the funniest thing we 'd ever heard .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why the hell was he resisting so badly ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The inability to correct it instantaneously is what drives one almost insane .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Seeing the man molesting Imogen he ran up , yelled and slapped her attacker across the face .
tr	NP_PP_.	Mad with need and desire .
tr	OTHER	Not on the stage but on top of the bar near the entrance .
tr	NP_VP_.	He looked at Ash as he spoke .
tr	S_VP_.	Tried to bring the idea of warmth to my shields , but all I could feel was the ice under my feet .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Pulling her tighter up against my chest I inhaled the smell of her shampoo and kissed her temple .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Within seconds the paper vanished .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If only he could see her and ask her about his father 's final moments of consciousness .
tr	OTHER	But we all had something in common .
tr	S_CC_S_.	They would be upon them soon and they had no time to call for their citizenry to attack .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she want to be a good girl or did she want to get fired ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could one woman change his life so much in just a few short weeks ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she stood and put her weight on her leg she cried out and fell .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I had to bring things to the front line .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it felt like a trail of energy passed from his body onto mine .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The memories I 'm dying to bury for good .
tr	NP_PP_.	Talk about your full-service store .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was hard .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The leases alone are worth a fortune .
tr	NP_VP_.	Carina lifted her brow .
tr	OTHER	And I certainly didn 't want to be beholden to a Vampire for anything .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only he wasn 't a child anymore .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That it 's some bizarre figment of my imagination and that I 'll wake up in captivity and all of this will have been a wonderful dream .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And we don 't even have any of the numbing agent here .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I wasn 't going to initiate it this time .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his dad disappeared less than a year later .
tr	OTHER	Its weight about 700 lbs .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you want to play a game ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He just went with the demands of his body .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he smiled at me slightly as he spoke to her , while keeping his eyes locked on mine .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	After I 'd been beaten up by hired thugs .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she snapped no one was safe .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As good as any he could come up with himself .
tr	VP_.	Taking the crisp , clean air into her lungs .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His heart beat soared and the thumping sounded in his ears .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even now she was beautiful .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I have no defense .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was he was he even doing that ?
tr	S_VP_.	""" Farming "" I said ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So there was no reason for them to stop .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Patrice finally gave up , closed the book and placed it beside her on the sofa .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would he do something like that ?
tr	OTHER	in a tone of voice as thin as his body .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever it was would have had to know how the crystal chest trick was performed .
tr	NP_VP_.	No one could get him angry faster than Aaron with his damn belligerence .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How would it happen ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He immediately began to backpedal .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Then a gentle intake and I throw myself under the surface .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then you 're all cozy with Foster the other night .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Only this time we somehow assumed a much more official stance .
tr	S_CC_S_.	When it broke into two pieces , we had to keep track of both of them or he could not go to sleep at night .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she 's barefoot .
tr	S_VP_.	Attached to it was an earpiece COMM link that transmitted directly to Paul .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was he asking this now ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she snapped out of her reverie she realised that Philip was talking to her .
tr	VP_.	Don 't be scared .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And everything in the room got real , real quiet .
tr	S_VP_.	To be trapped as a cat during the light of day was both painful and extremely disconcerting .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If he was an ally I 'd tell him I was grateful for everything he 's done for me .
tr	VP_.	""" In a manner of speaking ."
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What does he think , we 're all bloody runaway apprentices with trades ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But haste was not their friend , for they had already tarried too long .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he suspect her ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At first he didn 't know what exactly it was .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of knowing he wasn 't going anywhere .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I hit the ground .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	well folks we know are ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I don 't mind telling you I 'd hate to leave .
tr	S_VP_.	To be granted a golden ticket a person or demon had to carry at least $ 50,000 in cash on them .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he kissed her .
tr	S_VP_.	Frowning he sat in the chair alongside his bed , once more closing his eyes and letting the universes dark energy seep into him .
tr	NP_PP_.	An emergency of some sort .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you buy some new clothes ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she worried she 'd said too much ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Other than the size , and the hidden door , there was nothing here that differentiated it from the rest of the warehouse .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I really have no other choice than to follow him .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the light flickered .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Following them through a maze of corridors they eventually reached what looked like an emergency stairwell when the third explosion hit .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And right now she might just have a solution that didn 't involve donating to the blood bank .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She held out her arms and Henry got a big hug and a kiss on both cheeks .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For some reason my mood had turned more playful .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But yet a single acoustic guitar .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now there was a new threat .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the woman said she 's lived there for weeks .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What is the positive about that ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she was the bait .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For in saying them she was broaching a psychological threshold : that she and Finn could be a couple , or at least soon might be .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I heard running steps and a grunt as a very large man pushed the American guide off of me and into the river .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or at least it did exist at some time else or in some place else .
tr	NP_VP_.	""" ... "" Jake stayed silenced ."
tr	NP_PP_.	One minute for four thousand dollars .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe they had .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he wrote was less narrative than mission statement .
tr	VP_.	Fearful that the officers would return they quickened their pace and headed home .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he pulled back .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now it was morning .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Instantly he shot away through the jungle after his prey .
tr	OTHER	Our first video game .
tr	S_VP_.	Saying that was never going to get old .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Not since the first night had Fin found even one moment alone with her .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he come looking for her and you couldn 't bear to let anyone but you have her , so you killed him ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I couldn 't .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The man stepped out and Madame Veer appeared beside him .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he was wearing told her louder than words that he intended to go after the men who were shooting at them .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I hadn 't counted on was what a sweet , sensitive , romantic man lay beneath that mask .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although , I 'd have to decide if I wanted to exclude Shane and Tara from the name-dropping .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" One hundred miles out in the Pacific ?"
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Late the next morning she arrived at the audition at Screen Gems .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What was going on with Jensen was terrifying .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now we 're forced to deal with them .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I didn 't want them thinking he and I had much in common .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The lace fabric between her thighs was wet and the metal snaps gave way to my questing fingers .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you say you were making dinner ?
tr	S_VP_.	Leaving him hadn 't been about protecting herself .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we did , even though both of us kept finding ourselves bawling or puking -- usually at the same time .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	For almost a minute water splashed all around the pool .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did he come here ?
tr	S_VP_.	Staying much longer will drive me nuts .
tr	VP_.	Try to block him ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	She only had a handful of visits left before leaving for Paris and she wanted to make the most of them .
tr	S_VP_.	To be ignorant of getting dumped , of having my dreams dashed , of constantly feeling too inexperienced and stupid to deal with my own life .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	With that agreed the guys packed up and headed to the local pub on Christine 's suggestion .
tr	VP_.	Didn 't want a civilian to stumble upon this little war and get hurt .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Your children are adorable and Sadie is going to be a beautiful young woman .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it 'll be quite the show for you .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time she would succeed .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whenever the conversation turned to her social life all she wanted to do was escape .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then Todd asked Jack about Jerry Maguire .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He speaks very passionately and he had the crowd absolutely under his control .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And perhaps that was for the best .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If Jake could stop Amy reporting the event in the shopping mall he would have succeeded in saving the lives of his family .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she had failed to see a broken tree root protruding from the cliff face and pointing up like a sharpened stake .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the crazy as a cat on crack dream .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She was pliant in his arms and completely exposed to anything Gavin wanted .
tr	S_VP_.	Driving herself crazy wasn 't helping and sitting there all by herself was only fueling her paranoia .
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Searches for what ?"
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the mutagen takes effect in me I will shed this old , weak body for a new chimeric physique .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it did not stop those that were taking away a little girl , rough hands tangled in her dark hair , dragging her away .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he didn 't get was why his wrists felt raw .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Light was twinkling from every window and the front door was open .
tr	S_VP_.	Please be an intern for my father and we 'll see what happens .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But as always I was able to hide my more vulnerable emotions under a hefty pile of sarcasm and snark .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I stay put while I try to imagine what Ashton would feel like inside me .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	muttered the Inspector as the dwarf trotted off .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Two soldiers are left and they 're distracted by Kenji 's dance just long enough for me to take one down .
tr	OTHER	Just what I said .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was it with men and blonds ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And you have suffered for so long .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where 's your gratitude , woman ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was there even such a thing ?
tr	NP_VP_.	It seemed fairly sleepy which suited us , but still had good amenities and communications .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way I couldn 't trust you to help me .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I stupidly wandered from the path and suddenly found myself right on the edge of the cliff .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where did her treasures end up ?
tr	S_VP_.	Hearing it said out loud , especially by someone else was surreal .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the airport and during the flight the atmosphere was strained .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she retrieved it and returned it alongside the other in her jacket .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As Carol returned the courtesy I nodded over the intervening water to the Captain and thought ' size is important ' .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe then we 'll remember who we are .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they look like corpses , or merely like they were sleeping ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why wasn 't he affected by the illusions ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	"But then he added , "" I am curious , though ."
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But we need to discuss your feelings , Olivia .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I need to know .
tr	NP_PP_.	Her way of offering something .
tr	VP_.	gasped Jenna and Nicko .
tr	OTHER	Do you think you 're better than everybody else , Patti ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Two nights previously the saloon bar had been empty .
tr	OTHER	But for them to disappear ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I could feel her pain building in my head and I told her it would be over soon .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Something in his face suddenly changes .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	"Into the radio mike he said , "" New Orleans Coast Guard Radio ?"
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If they went around to check out the back of the house ... A gamble , but what other choice did he have ?
tr	OTHER	And did she have the necessary finances ?
tr	OTHER	But I spoke to the people in Silo 40 when I got back last night and they are going to help us figure it out .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She was truly a sight to behold , too bad she didn 't put much effort into showing it all off .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although , is that a possibility ?
tr	OTHER	They both shuddered , which made me laugh .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I have done it ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	""" All the better , "" he thundered ."
tr	OTHER	Instead , he continued to regard me , his gaze betraying his hurt and worry .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much of what spiders do is waiting .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For two weeks now his sense of smell had been much keener , no doubt a side effect of a strict diet .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His lips curled and he laughed too .
tr	S_VP_.	Being so close to the U.S. border wasn 't a fine line between deliverance and desperation , but a treacherous valley .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps all was not lost .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She then tried to tell him that if he went home with her then she might just let him in on the secret .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then he looked to his left and saw Brick .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't you just go to Mexico or something ?
tr	OTHER	Even with a fake name .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	"Where Laura was 5 ' 6 "" , Josie was barely tall enough to ride roller coasters ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On the near right corner was a closet , with a mirror on its right .
tr	OTHER	Not seeing any construction workers during a weekday afternoon seemed curious .
tr	OTHER	If only they had bread to go with it !
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When he was banished and cursed by a fairy godmother a thousand years ago and the kingdom found peace .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It gave her a heady feeling of feminine power that was unlike anything she had known .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At that moment several things happened .
tr	NP_VP_.	He had not been prepared for the gut-wrenching pain it caused him , or the violent emotions she stirred in him .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I shrieked with delight as I fell onto his chest and he positioned himself underneath me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night she had to break the cycle and immediately avoid the mausoleum .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Over the next eight years they got to know me real well .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I won 't .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just wasn 't sure what it was .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We just came from , I guess you could say , weak stock .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she just clung tightly to Zeus , blocking out the world that had let her down so cruelly , and sobbed her heart out .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I look out at everyone .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the past she had done most of the talking during her emergency room visits .
tr	S_VP_.	asked an excited Shivani , as both of them sat down on the steps .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But here you are .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I have to thank you .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The one he handed Zane was water .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What could I do to stop them ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Next to me Lucy picks the pepperoni off her slice , keeping her head lowered .
tr	OTHER	In the normal course of EXTRA !
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because she couldn 't think of a good reason didn 't mean there wasn 't one .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she felt a heavy weight land on her chest , knocking the air out of her .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the call ended Adams resumed without revealing his delight .
tr	S_VP_.	Turning the ignition is the action I dread most as it is what will make the most noise .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps that is because that is where the memory was physically located .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did he manage to keep it just the right length ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Olivia was going to make her guess .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In doing nothing I could only see the inevitability of gnashing teeth tearing me apart .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Taylor enjoyed the camaraderie he shared with Logan and I believe he secretly loved the attention from girls .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he placed the insignia in Edward 's outstretched , eager hand .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	An overweight slob of a women anxiously told a reporter what she had heard .
tr	NP_VP_.	Her children had arrived a bit earlier and were already dressed .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That it 's my emotions making me feel obligated .
tr	VP_.	Enclave to the north .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even if I can then I have to know enough about it 's physiology to ascertain if it is ' burrowing ' or not .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now those divine Surgeons had me tied down and were at work .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had she been the only one ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What am I going to do ... for the rest of my life ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Only one day in Seattle ."
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That it made you remember from the beginning ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Seems the dog got out and took off in the blizzard .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now there was Grace , too .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's going on ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I ruefully shook my head and switched off the TV .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Reaching for a bush , her small hands bleeding , the horse now close behind , she - Celaena gasped and awoke .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	twisting her leg and spinning her so she smashed to the ground on her side .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As far as they could see was a barren rocky landscape stretching until the land became a haze .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The two quickly hugged .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I didn 't tell him I was a paladin .
tr	OTHER	Could it be ignored , that horrible craving , that demonic taint ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I looked again she was still there .
tr	S_CC_S_.	If I wasn 't careful Kurt 's scam would be uncovered and it would be all over .
tr	NP_PP_.	Some magical way of getting your family out of this mess .
tr	VP_.	To be forgotten months , if not days , later .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What a man feared came upon him .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She 's equally beautiful and stuff but with her the problem is I don 't know her .
tr	VP_.	Challenging him to make the accusation .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By day 's end she might wish she had never moved to Settler .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she saw the basket of eggs on her counter , heard a movement over by the television , and realized it wasn 't Spike .
tr	NP_VP_.	Flo shook her head .
tr	VP_.	Thank you for your support .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What was left was riddled with a hundred little holes .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she disappeared back inside .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When he returned he noticed in pleasant surprise someone had been at the food .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The way it looks , the feel and scent of it .
tr	S_VP_.	Setting him on fire and lingering long enough to hear him scream .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she knew it would be a long time before she got over loving Conrad Hughes , if she ever did .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He was going to pound Tynan 's pretty face in next time he saw him for taking so much .
tr	S_VP_.	Getting my shit out of the place where I had nearly destroyed everything hadn 't been high on my list of priorities .
tr	OTHER	Someone willing to stomach a life with Bennett and Barb .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she 'd tell me not to be so attached .
tr	S_CC_S_.	His arms were strong and unyielding and I relished his warmth as I caught my breath again .
tr	NP_VP_.	The only thing left to be seen was what else could possibly happen before the song was over .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course A had had a front-row seat to what happened next .
tr	OTHER	But how do you forgive a monster ?
tr	NP_VP_.	He had wet himself .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just wanted to make the truth so evident to her that it would be impossible not to rub her disgustingly beautiful face in it .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he withdrew and thrust again , pushing his flesh right over the sensitive button of her desire .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then Mage exploded .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What kind of idiot was she ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now it was Smythe 's turn to stare in solemn silence .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the hall kept stretching farther and farther ahead of me .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he do this to me ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What sort of action is The Program proposing ?
tr	NP_PP_.	No more tiptoeing around him .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At first I thought maybe it had something to do with the Devil but Karina didn 't think so , not the FBI .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did all these fancy things make him a king ?
tr	VP_.	Take back nicking that 529 Pure Turbine .
tr	VP_.	To fly all the way to Russia to put a bullet in his own father 's head .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there seemed to be something about the dreams that I couldn 't quite figure out .
tr	S_CC_S_.	""" You got off easy , "" he muttered and he left the dead man ."
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I finally remembered the significance of the date , 14th September 1972 .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So this was it .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Because no one is abandoning you .
tr	NP_PP_.	No spontaneous yoga at full volume .
tr	S_VP_.	Touching me was the last straw .
tr	NP_PP_.	About all of it .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter Eleven The next day was torture .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she hadn 't told him about Richard .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he was brought into the presence of the gaping and dribbling Head .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she not realize that he could deny her just about nothing ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Although I fear I 'm destined to lie here and rot forever .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she had wanted it for herself !
tr	OTHER	They all looked at Eve , then glanced furtively at Alec except for a nearby blonde who assessed him boldly from head to toe .
tr	S_CC_S_.	We slowly entered the prop wash and I fiddled with the navigational controls to stabilize us as best as I could .
tr	NP_PP_.	screamed Logan in rage .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I leaned closer to gaze at the tubes .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he is awake .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And my whole body was like a fist .
tr	NP_VP_.	He winks at me over the roof of the car .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She almost screeched in frustration .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Eager to restore their family 's prestige they flocked together to join me .
tr	OTHER	How terrible to be dead , and know you were dead , and locked away in the darkness .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Unless you love them enough that you 're willing to do just about anything .
tr	OTHER	Even if it cost her life .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then you 're going to help us steal it .
tr	OTHER	Plenty of lights here .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The applause breaking the silence was the first thing to tell us we had a hit .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Love was something I was incapable of giving Delilah , but our child ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it must be a level of darkness even I can 't access .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Toby remembered that most of the other candidates were implicated in the murder of a child that evening .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so here we are , staring out into the dark night that never held any danger .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If he should die -- she herself said she couldn 't bear it .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If men were so committed to their children there wouldn 't be so many single mothers .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It really isn 't my thing anyway .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Just then Betty came into the room carrying a tray with three glasses of water .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did he have to be happy about ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	"If you could - "" But Charlotte , to Will 's surprise , had turned a pale shade of green ."
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Last week I feared the force of Edward would drown me , with the weekend confidence returned .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She finally locked gazes with her teacher .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did opportunity grace itself for Wayne to have a second chance ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	The robe had parted to reveal the long line of her legs but she barely even noticed .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I glowed ultraviolet inside .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just can 't believe this has happened .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it looked as if it just suddenly appeared in the sky .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	* * * Nightingale heard the dulcet female tones coming from a house as the sat-nav announced that he had arrived at his destination .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	"Why would you let me think - "" He glared over at me ."
tr	OTHER	But it still didn 't make me feel any better .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then my mind starts racing when I think about how much I want him , to kiss his lips , to feel his hands on my body .
tr	VP_.	Thank you for painting with me .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Although I do not know how I am going to sleep with it being so damn bright outside .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he want me to walk in or did he just forget ... was he just too out of it ?
tr	S_VP_.	- and making the hilt shine as if it contained the light of the sun .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What would I do ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Only when he hung up did Clay feel the beads of moisture just above his eyebrows .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At the secondary tunnel 's entrance stood a drone .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Instead I imagine the most gorgeous pair of navy blue eyes waiting for me .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So many will never make it home .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was this to be her future , a journey with Quinlan , a vampire she 'd been trying to get rid of for two months ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though I guess you can enjoy it a little bit .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I look at Madeline .
tr	OTHER	Was I ever really in danger ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	"Once you are in the Brotherhood you can 't leave "" he said ."
tr	S_CC_S_.	She followed and the minute she stepped into the cabin , she realized he 'd been at work here , too .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I picked up my bag at the door , took a taxi and headed to the address Briggs had given me .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would God spend a billion years watching a show like that ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the lectures were less than stellar the teens decided to wander throughout the complex .
tr	NP_VP_.	She surrendered to her mother 's fierce hug again , processing this new knowledge .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A possibility he couldn 't begin to contemplate .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was as if the tree had bent toward him , its thin , lifeless branches embracing his naked body like arms .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why concoct the story that he and the other agent so closely resembled each other ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And it 's up to you , which direction you will take .
tr	S_VP_.	Buried underneath the chandelier were two of his dead siblings , burning .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell had I thought would happen ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did this girl even know what we were ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With whomever she liked .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Maybe she and Brady could start whatever they were about to start and everything would be fine .
tr	NP_VP_.	I was mad for being stuck here .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Each morning she opened the white slatted blinds and said a prayer of thanks , grateful for the life she now had .
tr	S_CC_S_.	They went to the church and the priest , who was very wise , immediately grasped the situation .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now it 's time to meet the mastermind behind the wine .
tr	OTHER	Abe and Shorty both laughed .
tr	NP_PP_.	A moment of silence .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did they get past the forest master ?
tr	S_VP_.	Told me he gave you another warning .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I sat down on the sand to think .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there was little chance of the Band passing without causing a stir in the village anyway .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he was being told by encrypted directions to break the laws of the world in order to find something completely unknown to him .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As she spoke she fished out of her bag the keyfob photo of them both she kept for only these occasions .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I just come out and admit what a fuck-up I was ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was neither .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had she done that ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I shook my head .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I pushed open the door , darted around the corner of the cabin and started through the woods .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she used her thumb to smooth his dark brow after which she moved it down and she used it to stroke his bottom lip .
tr	NP_PP_.	An inside joke between them .
tr	S_VP_.	Hearing him say that he didn 't love me was a thousand knives through my heart .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she also have to blame him for it ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so she left , without another word to her daughter .
tr	NP_PP_.	My hands on his chest .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If the individual misses even a couple of doses of the drug an irreversible instability sets in .
tr	NP_VP_.	Alex softened just a little .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much depends on me .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I prepare myself for the worst .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	One day he went to the Birds ' Infirmary , which was a close distance , only a hundred and eighty kilometers away .
tr	NP_PP_.	An immortal version of what he 'd fantasized about .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeking out Rachel Flores was becoming more and more of a habit over the past days .
tr	VP_.	Realizing with shame that my fixation with assassinating Snow has allowed me to ignore a much more difficult problem .
tr	OTHER	Too insane to even think about .
tr	VP_.	Thank you for having us here .
tr	NP_PP_.	Still no movement from inside the car .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever doctors WICKED had unleashed on him had been brilliant at what they did .
tr	OTHER	A mouth that was pressed into a flat line now , waiting for his response .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Looking back at his son he discovered he was barely ten feet from him .
tr	S_VP_.	Destroying love and life was her sweetest revenge .
tr	S_VP_.	' Thank you very much , ' said Tiffany .
tr	NP_PP_.	Especially not to this man .
tr	NP_PP_.	My quite creator of beauty .
tr	NP_VP_.	The force of it propelled her back against the wall , her back jarring painfully against it .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the winter the windows , il - seated , would rattle in their frames when the wind blew .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he climbs into the other side .
tr	S_VP_.	Getting the tapes was only one problem .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Marissa blinked and dropped her arms at the same time Eric took a hasty step back .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it was a man thing because the coach believed him instead of me .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I looked up from the magazine as a guy my age entered .
tr	OTHER	Of her soft skin and inviting body .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She looked too much like her sister and I blamed all three of them about equally for messing up my life .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The tears I wasn 't sure I could hold back anymore all because I 'd gone and fallen for my bodyguard .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she want to do this ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it didn 't .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What kind of sign are you waiting for ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I don 't want to break her heart any further by telling her I can 't get her to her mother .
tr	S_VP_.	Thinking about how low I was when I moved to Seattle and how I was convinced nothing good would ever happen to me again .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But at least she waited .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today she had front row seats , right behind the batter 's box .
tr	NP_PP_.	Another subtle change in Beth that Charlotte had noticed since her return .
tr	OTHER	But at her trial they could prove nothing .
tr	NP_VP_.	I called my mother first , then my father , and finally , Paul .
tr	OTHER	Probably the largest factor in this Alliance home -- at least for her -- was the carriage house out back .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did blondie finally give up ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Just last week he and his guys trapped some unfortunate kid from the rival clan 's territory .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe a bloody fucking werewolf had come out of the hillside and killed George .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He started to peel off the label on the bottle of beer he was holding .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She was irritable every time I was alone in a room with her .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was stabbing Herr 'D on in the heart not your fault ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When did this happen ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Thus he and Polonius were free to stand at the rough gate and watch the delegation arrive .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What Priscilla didn 't agree with was doing it on her wedding day .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What we all need to do right now is begin construction of our rockets .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that man save me ?
tr	VP_.	asked the man on the other end .
tr	OTHER	Do I trust you more than I trust the government , in general ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I only have a moment to act , to interpret my father 's stunned silence and play it to my advantage .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With that kind of money I could afford a full-time nurse .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so I wrote the book in a fever in two weeks -- like how Jack Kerouac had written ' On The Road ' .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had he run in so fast that she hadn 't seen it ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he stood by their table , directly behind Arnie , looking very pleased that he had this news to tell .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In his tired state Neil thought it was the greatest bus ever invented .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I suddenly felt awake and noticed an odd numbness at the end of my wounded leg .
tr	NP_PP_.	A life without passion ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But we persist in judging them by our human standards .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would he leave something so powerful , vulnerable ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Janet finally found her voice .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because this was important , and if my dad would let me get tortured then I decided he wasn 't my dad anymore .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why can 't I just brush my hair and go ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I still thought about that shadow .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I 'll take care of the flank defences .
tr	VP_.	Go to the closet and open it and oust out all the clothes .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In the refrigerator I found a leftover tuna salad and a Budweiser .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time the door opened without a hitch .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she know of somewhere around here he could get lunch ?
tr	S_VP_.	Being a single mom is a lot harder than I thought it would be , even with Mom and Dad 's help .
tr	NP_PP_.	No acknowledgment of a near-death experience .
tr	VP_.	From here , from her .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you have something in mind ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	There it was again .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who wins with the most believers , lives .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I focused my talent on finding my lost way but I felt nothing .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Unfortunately the worthless cursing was all she could do as the clearly crazed human waved about his knife .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she not realize I was doing all I could do not to find an empty corner and run my hands and tongue all over her body ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At this he smiled .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I had made that mistake before and it had nearly cost me everything .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It only takes me a few seconds to dash back to my room and grab the bat .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then we would be the best of friends .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are we having this conversation ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he handed it to Emma .
tr	S_VP_.	Just looking at him made her smile .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the bottom Andrew released Miss 's hand and set Little Miss down on the damp sand .
tr	VP_.	Don 't let him fool you .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every day I checked my phone about ten times waiting for Dion 's number to pop up .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I quickly stuffed my notes into the bag , and stood up while he looked on disapprovingly .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time they messed with me .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	CHAPTER TWELVE The next day at school I can 't stop thinking about last night 's exploration with Sebastian .
tr	NP_PP_.	Thanks to you , my dear reader , for taking your time to read this book .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And beside him was Sylvie .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I went to Body Time and got on the treadmill for a while , and did a little upper body work .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Used a ceremonial sword the general had given his son as a present .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	While she was speaking Miss Hardcastle was undoing her belt .
tr	OTHER	Not through any sense of caution .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it was just a mugger .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today I needed to believe he was right .
tr	S_CC_S_.	""" She would love it if you asked her , "" Eden gushed and I had to agree ."
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Bremer had already lied .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What Edwin didn 't know was they were recording the phone call .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Cindy didn 't appear to be angry .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	"At the end she tapped her cane vehemently against the floor and said , "" George , that 's absolutely horrible ."
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I knew Liv was out for her dad 's birthday , which left me with nothing but schoolwork and laundry .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If Queen Helen is aiding our enemies then she must die .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I was not the witness of her grief , for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long , long time .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When she turned the door handle relief surged through her that it opened and led outside .
tr	VP_.	""" Waiting for you ."
tr	VP_.	Tell me what it does .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he lay still .
tr	OTHER	Because these people are supermen !
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Verity sensed a fierce desperation in him instead of the many levels of passion she had come to expect in recent months .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where does mind end and body start ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why have Willy set her wing and bring her all the way out here ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But mercenaries do not fight with the same vigor as well motivated troops .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon her thoughts became a jumbled montage of images from a past increasingly hard to suppress .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely she could marry him and keep herself indifferent if he was disagreeable .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At once she could hear the heartbeat of a small rabbit .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How he 'd brought her dinner .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell did the man expect her to do that made her sound so unwilling to do it ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	You 'd become more light-sensitive and your senses would become more acute , but not noticeably so .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But sadness existed there .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did Jack know that I was getting out early ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Glad I can amuse one of them at least .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When he returned the state trooper was no longer standing in front of Bash 's room .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That night she was in the mood for mindless entertainment and for leaving adulthood for awhile .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I 'm brushing a kiss across his cheek and breezing toward the door .
tr	NP_PP_.	Almost tired of the fight .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Malcolm shoved forward with that stake .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Her eyes constantly dart to the door , as though she is considering making a break for it .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He didn 't bother telling her the debris was keeping him from finding other ships .
tr	S_VP_.	Being out in the living world left her infinitely lonely .
tr	NP_PP_.	Son of a whore !
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If someone wouldn 't have interfered ?
tr	S_VP_.	To walk away would certainly guarantee Serenity 's death .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Had they just turned him down ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it was she who was sad and lonely .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could there be ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a minute there was silence .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	As I crossed over I looked along towards Portland , and tried to see if there were any soldiers posted as the fisherman had suspected .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She just didn 't know .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she and I had was real .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it started to rain , heavily .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He had so many questions , so many things he wanted to ﬁnd out from her .
tr	NP_PP_.	About nine on each shift .
tr	S_VP_.	Didn 't let anyone love me .
tr	OTHER	Even rejoice in the beauty of it .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Next I kicked off my shoes and put on the new ones which had a cushioned sole and cupped my feet well with laces on top .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he spent no time thinking about Lauren Pauling or Kate Lane .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As if his current transformation was suppressing the signal .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that was easy .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Normally I just walk around aimlessly and just enjoy the scenery around me while it is bathed in light .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just wasn 't ready to admit it to myself .
tr	NP_VP_.	I knew what it meant .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After settling Sean on the couch I went to bed .
tr	S_VP_.	To say the dwellings were subterranean would only be half true .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It was kitschy and that 's what made it so adorable .
tr	NP_VP_.	No more fooling around with all of those unrelated questions about his hair , his eyes , his name , his birthplace , or anything else .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Yet I didn 't welcome him with open arms either .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I met your sister .
tr	S_VP_.	Knowing she 'd be around Finn .
tr	OTHER	A woman who wasn 't Kate .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At the top they find themselves alone with their rescuer and their questions .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I saw Angelus standing there , glued to the book , reading in the light of the flickering green and gold flames .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she looked back at The Tavern with a frown on her face .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he did so it was with an energy and speed that Toby hardly credited .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's wrong with you ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But here she was , walking around the base at two a.m. , not a guard in sight .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Between them a bear rose on its hind legs , so massive she froze in stunned terror .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I decided to lurk and catch you when you emerged .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Each now thought back on the times spent with their own mothers .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She gently held Thomas ' hand , and ran his sleeve up to expose the tattoo .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And I tell him to hang on .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	There aren 't many of them , no more than twenty or thirty anywhere I go .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Some of the tiny grains of irritation even made it under the waistband of his threadbare khaki pants .
tr	OTHER	So no food for another hour and half then .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they will breach the gates and fight with the evil they unleash .
tr	OTHER	And what did they do with the chairs he sat in while in their establishments , the dishes he ate from , the towels he used ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps her presence would offer him some comfort .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He slowly brought his hand to mine .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If you get in too deep , take a step back and let one of us go in .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Or was it October ?
tr	VP_.	Makes one nostalgic for those awful days when it was just two hairy giants with clubs , circling in a primitive face-off .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Cale really go through all of this trouble to show me how sorry he was for that picture with Kallie ?
tr	S_VP_.	To have him let go of that last bit of control .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she tell them what really happened ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But these particular consequences seemed the least of my worries .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was Jonah being pestered for his own version of what happened at the quarry ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Had she made the right decision today ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there 's that television crew .
tr	NP_PP_.	The blood in the air .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Hours later Avery stumbled in drunk to join her and he soon snored soundly next to her , none the wiser .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I hear tape ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	There he was concerned that I had been abused as a child while I was fantasizing about a hidden red room of pain .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even if your eyesight returns to normal you must maintain a certain inability to see .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then other creatures did the same , darting out from behind at least a dozen other trees that lined the boundary between the field and the forest .
tr	OTHER	Now , whereas Jane had abandoned Christianity in early childhood , along with fairies and Santa Claus , Mark had never believed it at all .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Just how did you find out that he 'd spent the night ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	He gestured and the dagger in Aldred 's hands transformed into a red snake .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Somehow I didn 't think so .
tr	S_VP_.	Dying and coming back to life had taken my energy .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was no use .
tr	OTHER	She remembered the shock in Patrick 's eyes when she 'd at last told him , the gasp of dismay from his upright wife , Rona .
tr	VP_.	said Anatole behind us .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you ever see him taking one ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he hesitated to answer .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The first few minutes we didn 't say a word to one another .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At last they stepped through a wide doorway and into what must have been the main dining hall .
tr	NP_VP_.	I kiss him back , knowing that we have a lifetime of sunrise kisses before us .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I went to fetch her lover as I 'd promised .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he returned she had just finished up .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she quickly cleaned the baby and its small cry echoed over the quiet room .
tr	NP_VP_.	It will do me no harm , I assure you .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He was in this for life and he only wanted her .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But right now survival is key .
tr	VP_.	Wondering the fate of Lieutenant Jack Strong and his longtime sniper .
tr	VP_.	""" What about you ?"
tr	S_VP_.	Coming in heavy will be a problem more than getting out .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he saw me he cringed so miserably that I could not help feeling pity intermixed with wonder .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When he grew tired of playing they would not survive .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With speed he covered the cable at the base of the tree , and then covered any sign of the cable on the floor .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it wasn 't empty .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he moved away , putting space between them , tilting her off his lap and into her own corner of the seat .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he screamed and fled .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he found instead was a brutal culture seeded heavily with corruption .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But not before I put up a damn good fight .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For now she would revel in the beauty of his broad shoulders , his muscled chest and rippling abs , knowing that he would soon be hers .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Adding to my confusion I felt my bowels and bladder relax .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Cain never needed anyone .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Only when he 'd cut himself off from all emotions had he experienced any relief .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So the CIA pointed the IRS at them .
tr	NP_VP_.	There is no first name on the sheets .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	During the ride from the airport to Sara 's hotel both remained silent .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only they didn 't know the real devastation .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she relaxed as best as she could and took the routine dosage .
tr	OTHER	Was I such a bad kisser that he was disgusted by me ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The sparkling green of his eyes emitted kindness and his hands were soft as he touched her arm in greeting .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I was sore and uncomfortable but I was alive !
tr	VP_.	Found a netbook a while back .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there was her arm .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Though , with the noise she could 've loudly reprimanded herself without Jeff hearing .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	According to Dr Keiser he was showing a lot of progress up until about a month ago .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As if it were ours .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Dianna was stunned not only by his presence , but by everything he was saying .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had he visited her ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he think he 'd known me long enough to be that direct ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Then she and her friends all did an about-face and strolled off , some of them in different directions .
tr	NP_PP_.	' Know of him .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just before he was about to close it behind him he poked his head back out .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	To his liking she was quite pleasant with him .
tr	S_VP_.	Taking a blow to the head or the ribs is one thing .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was it Man decided these labels was to represent ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it hit me like a thunderbolt .
tr	NP_VP_.	I 'd better get going .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Some day I promise to write something where the Austrians are not the bad guys .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you really think I would come out just because you ordered me to ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That way you can go .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she expect him to keep the Italian government intact ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I stayed put to see Lucas walk up to her .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did her cheeks flush when she glanced in his direction ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have to say shoot ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But she didn 't move toward it .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon belt , trousers and boxer shorts were sliding down his lean legs to the floor .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he relieved she had departed ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How are your men doing ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before he could speak she went on .
tr	NP_PP_.	Quinlan guided Emma out the door and across the parking lot .
tr	NP_PP_.	New clothes from some charity outfit .
tr	VP_.	asked Sunny , visibly disgusted .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Jack then placed his arm into his makeshift sling and turned his horse down the lane .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he took the flare gun and ejected the clip from the handle to check the bullets .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I 'm not maternal .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The war is still in full swing and the hatred and hostility towards each other is growing every single day .
tr	VP_.	Fuck the no sex thing .
tr	S_VP_.	Clothes and shoes and who knows what else littered every inch from wall to wall .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	After he realized she could - and quite happily - take anything he had to give .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he pulled into his gravel driveway John saw his bedroom light was still on .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where did a TV station get their hands on that ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Same thing with the bra ."
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I seemed to hear the faint flutter of ghostly wings coming from the back of the hall .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	She herself had had more than a few sleepless nights in the days before he came home for good .
tr	OTHER	Should she tell anyone about what she remembered ?
tr	VP_.	asked Ward after he got down from the wagon .
tr	OTHER	Had the problem been his ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I didn 't like to think about it being one of the only connections I had to my mother .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Daniel began removing the strips of cloth he had used for packing of the wounds .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Dougal finally nodded and let Graham help him around the writhing vines .
tr	OTHER	Would Margaret be willing to wait a year , based on their slender acquaintance ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	We got drunk and I guess we got separated .
tr	NP_VP_.	"Adam continued , "" The ley lines are energy ."
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes they sat out the entire meal with their gloves on .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What 's in you has taken root and would resist .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was going on here ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He felt flustered , but looked at the timetable again in case he 'd got it wrong .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I wasn 't Will 's mistress .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I would forget whoever I was before all of this .
tr	VP_.	Definitely a hellacious couple of weeks of surprises .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Already I missed his touch .
tr	NP_PP_.	"An explanation of your dislike of Will - "" "" I 've told you !"
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it indicated nothing at all .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did it fixate on Kalla ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When the doors opened I jolted out , walked through the lobby , and into my Pontiac .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the Healer come by to discharge us ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they kill my dad ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I don 't know why I made reference to that morning .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could water this cold not be frozen ?
tr	S_VP_.	Pressing forward he approached the crest of the southward pass .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he thinks about how , if he 's a pain in the butt , he won 't get asked to go anywhere else again .
tr	OTHER	The door that led to the outside !
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the screaming started and didn 't stop till the last man died .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just don 't know what the worst would be .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	How in the world that had slipped her mind was beyond her .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps they 'd be the first things she unpacked when she arrived at the Slayton place -- her new summer home .
tr	NP_PP_.	Full of rich Arabs .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then it 's a free for all .
tr	NP_PP_.	Sorry for leaving without telling you anything .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	All the time he kept his grip firm in her hair .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	No one ever got to see .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I sat in a chair in the hall , and waited , and worked on my story some more .
tr	VP_.	Making the city louder ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	During those times was when I 'd supposedly written the notes to myself .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Or the legs , as long as she stayed away from the inner thighs .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then her sarcasm finds its way to the surface .
tr	OTHER	And what about Shannon ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely Bigsby had made certain none of the sick had worsened .
tr	NP_PP_.	His kind of an area .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Mrs. Hearst 's lip curled with anger and she yanked her arm out of his grip .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Not that it mattered since I had no clue what Maddie looked like anyway .
tr	S_VP_.	Keep pushing it out of your mind and things will eventually straighten themselves out , right ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because that always seemed to happen when we were together .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Pain screamed through me and the feeling of the carpet against my cheek disappeared .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was wrong with me ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	She held it up over the grimy flannel shirt she 'd been wearing since they 'd left the farmhouse .
tr	NP_VP_.	Just let me do my thing and everyone will know you 're taken .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he started naming countries .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Apparently he was bound and determined to include us all .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even though I would not be staying on the Island I could still never be with Matthias .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why do you ask anyway ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It vaguely resembled a crab .
tr	NP_VP_.	I feel his hand slide up my thigh .
tr	VP_.	Felt like slow motion , as the knife sliced its way out of Della 's chest .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he joined the police force .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would he even want to ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you used her own greed against her to pay for this getaway .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I shake my head .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she begins to scream .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	When they got to Los Angeles everything went just as Sherman had planned .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He pulled her out of her seat and she fell into his lap .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now it was up to her to make a great impression .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Near his door he could hear the subwoofer throbbing to some action-adventure film .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That I should stay home and let them help .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	12 He was back .
tr	NP_VP_.	It was a good look .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She also knew that Julia wouldn 't rise to the bait .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I 'd still be hopping over the fence to see him when I was twenty years old with his ring on my finger .
tr	NP_PP_.	Understatement of the year .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she looked upward into her glowing countenance she realized she was looking at the face of the tigress character from the television show .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did it make sense to cal attention to the fact that a bunch of new vampires were claiming Seattle as their hunting ground ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then her heart stopped .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Regularly the news reports were updated .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she think her job wasn 't important ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	If they think one of us is evil , then they 'll think all of us are evil , just like Levon said .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he noticed an old man , digging in the dirt not more than forty feet away .
tr	NP_PP_.	A moment of panic .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although , I felt my heart burn with hope like something was pushing me forward .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So much emotion was in her eyes , blazing just as brightly as the flames .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the remnants that my mother 's talons had left behind were not something I wanted him to see .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I argue with that ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	He tries to lower himself onto the pillow beside me but I can still feel his heat , his figure , his heart pounding in my ears .
tr	VP_.	cried the distraught boy .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he was close enough to touch , his smile caressing her as he took her hands in his .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I had talked this over with Herb and he agreed pushing the crew now would allow time to correct deficiencies before we sailed for real .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now it is too late .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she slipped both back into her pocket .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Although no one really knew what the casket was , or what it looked like .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Without further ado he beat out the rhythm of , Only When it 's Saturday .
tr	OTHER	Was he following orders from you when he did that ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I shouldn 't have said those things to him .
tr	NP_VP_.	I pressed my lips around the opening and sucked the contents down in one gulp .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Because I feel her emotions , because I am right there with her , experiencing everything that she sees and hears and tastes and smells and touches .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What must he think of me ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she took in the girls ' confused looks .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Three minutes since the last time I checked .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So AZT must kill hundreds , or even thousands of good T cells to kill just one cell infected with HIV .
tr	OTHER	Disappointing but not surprising .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once found it waits inside scanning for victims , for those who look as though they 'd appreciate the rest .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The walls fall away and all around me I see flames leaping high toward the ceiling .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then these decisions were carried out to the point by faithful servants like the hideous character .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Yes I am afraid of you .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he got away with it , fleeing Rome with a price on his head .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe she was imagining the danger , jumping at shadows , like she had with that red Toyota on Highway 5 .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Dinner that night is a cheerful affair .
tr	NP_VP_.	"Mother warned while holding back her tears , "" Baby , we 're getting help ."
tr	S_CC_S_.	She smiled at him and he chuckled .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The south had searched for years but her mother and sister were never found .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was her name ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If this was a game , then it 's like one of Dwan 's street games .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had she done this to him ?
tr	OTHER	Have I met them at one of those perhaps ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Spent Christmas with her and Cale .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why in the world was she thinking about the man 's fingernails ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Daniel just stood there looking .
tr	NP_PP_.	At least for tonight .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because her mother had opted to continue in her marriage didn 't mean Carly wanted to deal with things the same way .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Trevor use the same soap ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would he fight now ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he 'd just change back and leave .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Amy moved from under the weight of her sleeping stepfather and gently lowered his head onto the seat .
tr	OTHER	This , Callum thought , though she couldn 't know , was exactly true .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you notice the way she was ignoring him ?
tr	VP_.	Usually about 30,000 words a week .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It also helped them fight the rain .
tr	NP_PP_.	All four of them .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why is he comatose ?
tr	OTHER	How long had it been ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Hector was aware of the biting words Patrick and I 'd exchanged .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Don 't you worry .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course she meant more than that .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now Edwin and Crystal were looking at me carefully .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And also we sat and talked , wondering what was happening away south in Rohan , and what had become of all the rest of our Company .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	For her to call in the middle of a field school must mean something important .
tr	S_VP_.	Staring at Patrick made her want to live again .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she looked up again her face was rosy with a guilty blush .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he felt ready , if a little flustered .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Jeremy had a one night stand with some girl he met at a bar .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In Cabanas we had coffee with an old sugarcane worker who still lived in his own two room house .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he want us to try again ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What I was feeling wasn 't right .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the price tag will be two million .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every day a multitude of decisions took each soul nearer or further away from death .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do I get through the German lines ?
tr	NP_VP_.	The chameleon began doing its pushups again , convinced the threatening technique would work on Charles just as it did the crow .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Then when some unwary human got on they galloped to the nearest water .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She tried to break us up and it almost worked .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The victory in his eyes almost scared her as his large body moved between her legs .
tr	S_VP_.	Being eliminated , by an ambitious senator or overlord , was rather common .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he pulled his hands from the keyboard and took a big breath through his mouth .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Domenico had not come to her room last night and she didn 't know if she was okay about it .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Putting a hand on each shoulder she squeezed them tight .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surprisingly her lip stopped trembling , her glassy eyes pierced him with such longing , he nearly forgot to breathe .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she jumped .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why does he stay with you ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She couldn 't hear her breathing .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After a few hours I would say goodnight to Jett and head off to bed exhausted .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she closed her eyes to try and find something more at home , something that she would recognize .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How had all that ruckus been born , and why blood had been shed in the halls of a high school in Rome ?
tr	OTHER	She 'd seen many faces of the man but never once had she seen this on his features .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Jett 's eyes wandered to my mouth and his gaze turned a shade darker .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Behind us I heard someone call out as they stumbled .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As they walked past him Raj caught his interested stare .
tr	S_VP_.	Giving me a completely different forever to end my days .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Some of them even enjoy what they become .
tr	NP_VP_.	Kylie gave them the short version and promised she 'd tell them all the gory details later .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	Yet he had offered her no harm .
tr	NP_PP_.	A treasure for the world .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that was where Crawley had been running to : to where he used stay , where he would be safe .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If anyone would know what to do it would be streetwise Caz .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where were you the rest of the weekend ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least I hoped we were .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did all this happen ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he entrusts a company of the Cayman Islands with making a bank transfer .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	By lunch it was clear the little bat was done in .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Yet there he was , loving , gentle , eager to be a part of her and Emma 's life .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that 's okay .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But Ted was early .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now there was only hurt and loss and suffering .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I angrily wipe it away .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Tears formed in her eyes as she reminded herself that she was dead and she would never have the answers to her questions .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That way we can catch some of the rainwater .
tr	NP_PP_.	The undulation of the room and the wild how of the wind exclaimed they were now at sea .
tr	OTHER	We both looked toward the far end of the runway as the orange Piper revved up its engines for takeoff .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She mentally congratulated herself as she seized the cheap tin of face powder .
tr	S_VP_.	Having someone she loved buried here changed things .
tr	NP_VP_.	Noah and I go way back .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Hatch anchored the stake on a struggling strawberry plant he 'd grafted from home .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a cubicle along the back wall a third noob hunched in his chair , facing a screen filled with lines of code .
tr	S_VP_.	Just hearing it sent a fist of pain straight through her heart .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once I have programmed you may then climb in yourselves .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was that really enough to keep her mom from calling for help ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had he gotten in ?
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing someone other than my mom cry for me instead of because of me is a new experience .
tr	OTHER	Eventually though they reached him .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Instead he handed me a flat package , the size of an envelope , neatly wrapped in black lace .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there 's the Secret Shell , which no one notices , because it 's not on one of the main highways .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As the knife cut across his shirt he followed it with his own knife , feeling it catch on more than cloth .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She said it in the form of a question but Milton grunted his approval of her remark instead of starting a conversation for which she had hoped .
tr	OTHER	Unless you 're up for that .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had he remembered that ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	she answered , trying to look innocent and thinking maybe she failed for he was studying her closely .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though there was no interpretation of those cards that sounded like a fun time .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who says government is inefficient ?
tr	S_VP_.	Crossing the threshold into the pipe room the roots of the tower sprawled in every direction and terminated into the walls of the room .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was then I spotted tousled dark purple hair in the chamber across from us .
tr	OTHER	The minute his hands glided across her skin , it felt as if it was on fire .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once he brought himself back together he continued .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I wanted him to hold me hard .
tr	NP_PP_.	At least for the moment .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I could show him I wasn 't weak .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I hold her quietly , breathing in her scent as I contemplate her last words .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did I tell you ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Jumping over logs and roots and ducking under any trees branches that came across their path .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	"Miranda frowned in concentration , "" Was it Zach ?"
tr	S_CC_S_.	If any of you make any hostile moves , you will die and your village will be burned to ashes .
tr	NP_PP_.	This son of yours , Jamal .
tr	OTHER	Was he that obvious ?
tr	NP_VP_.	I made it clear the moment when we pulled off the road , hell , when I just held on to you in my kitchen .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In a few minutes Beth appeared outside , standing in the midst of the school , swinging her net , catching specimens .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so he 's pretty much left her to her own devices all these years .
tr	OTHER	Or were they maybe in contact with her , despite her imprisonment ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know I was here ?
tr	OTHER	But why did men find war irresistible ?
tr	VP_.	Hated herself for it .
tr	NP_VP_.	Soccer wasn 't Holly 's strong point .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Thomas was taken away somewhere and she was rushed into a medical unit for debriefing .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were they gathered still together in that fairy-tale wood of monster trees , where I had seen my mother walking ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Bo chuckled and my stomach clenched in response to the rich , sensual sound .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it required him reading only a couple more copies of the October editions of the paper before he found his next nugget .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Joseph brought two large warm capes from the carriage .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When resting she glanced back to use the beehive tree as the marker for where she had come from in the morning .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It quickly passed along with the static , before the crowd slowly came back into focus .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	' Thank you ' she mouthed .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it was he who avoided her .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And eventually he starts to rock .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment Kaplan seemed to waver .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	I fell for them hard the moment I saw them .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did he go and touch the dragon 's egg ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Something about him just attracts girls .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Sara starts mumbling , excitement overtaking her .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or rather I have never .
tr	VP_.	Don 't jump to conclusions .
tr	NP_PP_.	Lots of hot , sweaty , dirty , satisfying sex .
tr	VP_.	said a voice behind him .
tr	S_VP_.	Seemed the way to Dex 's heart was anything that would help his filmmaking .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What would take them months to recover from we can do so in minutes .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he did the unexpected : he charged .
tr	S_VP_.	Staring up below him was his father .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was she worrying about Roar ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Gone sometime in the night or the morning , in the few unguarded hours Dan ' r had slept .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just as he suspected Samson awaited him .
tr	OTHER	Or the sub shop , or the Irish bar .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What are we going to do with the demon 's whore now ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Because none of them had ever been particularly memorable .
tr	NP_PP_.	One of the most popular , too .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He used every ounce of self-control he possessed to keep his voice from cracking in laughter .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As I left I could feel the principal 's glare on my back .
tr	NP_PP_.	All in preparation for a hit that was to take place later on .
tr	OTHER	What if he is cheating ?
tr	NP_PP_.	A grand finale of sorts , which pleased Jax to ridiculous levels .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But maybe it wasn 't so surprising at that .
tr	VP_.	Vulnerable in the groin , stomach , and head .
tr	S_VP_.	Sighing she put her head in her hands and rested her arm on the sill .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who would I tell ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could a car catch fire in the middle of a blizzard ?
tr	VP_.	Remorse and blame flood from his eyes .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	* * The overcast had blown away by the next morning , uncovering a sky bright enough to make Tristan squint .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Chapter 3 While in Washington DC , my thoughts are elsewhere as I ´ m distracted by the beautiful and incredibly powerful sights in the area .
tr	OTHER	Will you let me stay here as long as I want if I 'm successful ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the Master hesitated and looked from one to the other .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where did we turn so far wrong ?
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And prayed she wasn 't making the biggest mistake of her life .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What made the 6502 so successful was two-fold .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But at least his nose quit bleeding .
tr	S_VP_.	Saving up money for private accommodations was impossible in Black Cross , where any money was supposed to belong to the group rather than the individual .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe my dad had called him .
tr	OTHER	I was so exhausted , I wanted to fall over , but I held myself straight , even when my escorts let go and pushed me forward .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	* * * * Steve 's Mechanical Drawing class , without Godzilla , is considerably better .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"As the horse begins to gallop he quips , "" I feel a lot more secure now , "" showing his playful nature ."
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he turns towards his assistant .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We just talked for an hour .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know that a jiffy is an actual measurement of time ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Protecting which parts I wonder ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then you know the power of a sharp point .
tr	S_VP_.	Letting her taste herself on his lips .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you want to have some breakfast with me ?
tr	VP_.	Looking poised and polished and in control of herself and everything around her .
tr	VP_.	Be that , though , as it may .
tr	OTHER	Would I feel this way if she weren 't so lovely ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The beginning of the blasted end .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he knew better than to reply .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And here Colin Morgan was , offering her a way .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Who can even tell what the world really is ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you ever say anything like that about Blaire again I will cut you loose .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Except for the day I left .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Nodding to me he turned to leave when I remembered I needed to talk to him .
tr	NP_PP_.	"About half an hour out of town I saw a sign I welcomed : "" You are leaving Louisiana ."
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he yanked his gaze to Keeley .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where did you even learn that ?
tr	S_VP_.	Knowing I 'd want to die if I didn 't .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell just happened ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And that 's just the entrance gate .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	and the little monk gasped , dropping his sword in pain .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet Trevor could not resist spying .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Scary how well I 've come to know their thought processes since we 've been here .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now Theo could see that the previously dreary guitar was simply a sympathetic shoulder for the lyrics to cry on .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Fortunately he hadn 't landed completely on top of her .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But now was not the time to examine his sudden change of heart .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I told her daddy had been touching me , and I didn 't like it , and I wanted it to stop .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How in the Hell was he going to play that ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What did they do with their clothes ?
tr	NP_PP_.	Dark green button-up with white cuffs and collar .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Any tribulation she suffered he wanted to suffer as well .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it was best that she wasn 't going to have it .
tr	NP_PP_.	Stay in your bedroom .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe he 'd recall the first name but not the last .
tr	VP_.	Do ya think a small bottle 'd hurt any .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe I hadn 't noticed them before , maybe Angelica wasn 't the only one showing signs from that year .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	* There was little point in either George or Jennie staying in London .
tr	S_CC_S_.	It would be their first physical sign of affection but Clara felt certain Edward was ready .
tr	NP_VP_.	He 's getting the best care we got , and no more and no less .
tr	NP_VP_.	I shrugged and tried to comb through the new ideas flowing through my head .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where could my kids be ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But I doubt he cared .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did this happen ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she know she owned it yet ?
tr	S_VP_.	Turns out I 'm not just another pretty face .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's this all about ?
tr	VP_.	said Salvatore as he shot up .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	A few seconds later she came out of the kitchen carrying a pink box and a smile .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So Maya had reluctantly agreed .
tr	NP_PP_.	Something like the Cliff .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why in the hell am I letting her do this ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he looked up at the sun , low down in the western sky .
tr	NP_PP_.	More than a collection of atoms strung together in the shape of a mountain of a man .
tr	VP_.	Pay for this or go in the Marines .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I mean I know some things , that your father died when you were young and you didn 't get a lot of support as a child .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What we really meant was , Please , someone try .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did adore mean love ?
tr	VP_.	Think they don 't report suspicious activity at the drop of a hat ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would Lysander leave the coven , then ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was the rope starting to give around her left wrist ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	My mouth fell open and I sat gaping at Mother 's image on the screen .
tr	NP_PP_.	My mate in all ways .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He headed towards it , opened the door and yes , it was virtually empty .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there 's your dad .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he think Peters was just an old crack pot ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Figures she would disguise it in her garbled way of speaking .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What she was doing wasn 't working .
tr	VP_.	Dial one and then the rest of the number .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Then how is it that I have the power ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She left the question hanging delicately .
tr	VP_.	Find the bruise , find the wound .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because I thought you two should know that I was about to say it .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I began to realize .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	So they still trained with them and still carried them everywhere .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I say it was like I won the lottery ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	The gods of humans were less protective but there were many more humans to go around .
tr	VP_.	Cloak who and what you are and never trust anyone .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Pity she had no weapon .
tr	OTHER	And from that point they 'd be a family again .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I tried not to believe anything .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you think I hadn 't noticed the wooden stick in your hand earlier today ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For the verses maybe he should just use the same four chords - F , the G , the A and the B .
tr	NP_VP_.	That morning Jake spent a long time making me come , making me dazed , and making love to me .
tr	OTHER	Then another silent pause .
tr	NP_VP_.	His eyebrows lifted with interest .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I suddenly feel like the job is more important than me meeting Megan again .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I have become a genuine wanted criminal !
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever it was didn 't want to move the bodies .
tr	NP_PP_.	Inflammation of the cheeks .
tr	VP_.	Get a full statement .
tr	NP_VP_.	No one at the base knew for sure as it lost radio contact and couldn 't report its condition or its location .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were the fates aligned against her ?
tr	VP_.	Remember all you have seen , for it all will come to pass , in some form or other , be it today or years from now .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She nearly changed her mind .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Including using those you love .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she fear him like she did her father ?
tr	OTHER	Was he afraid of her ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	He let go and I fell backward .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But they came back to me from the forwarding address she 'd left in Berkeley .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did Abby know that 's what she and Summer called Jude ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But the nervous man did not .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Tell Grace she 's doing far better than Grace herself is from the sound of it .
tr	S_CC_S_.	He 'd lusted for her and he 'd wanted to possess her .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Again he gave me that look .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Then the sounds of the forest filtered in .
tr	VP_.	asked David , keeping his eyes on the road the siren clearing the traffic .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What appears healthy and vital is not .
tr	S_CC_S_.	There was a knock at her door and Serena spun around to see her father peeping in .
tr	S_VP_.	Watching the tension build as the guests delved deeper into their arguments made me very conscious of the futility of political debates .
tr	NP_PP_.	The angel and I glance at each other .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she hearing a job offer ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It still has power .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But it wasn 't ugly .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because you care for someone doesn 't give them the right to make decisions for you .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	A kiss she prayed Tanner had forgotten .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For some reason John had seen this as a means of him getting back with Eileen .
tr	OTHER	Can I trust him ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even in this dream like state I was nervous and excited .
tr	S_VP_.	Sitting in bed was approximate to losing her mind , if there was anything left at all to lose .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I remembered that Lucas had tried to tell me once about his mother and how controlling she could be .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But that was something they could save for another time since he enjoyed taking her as human so much .
tr	VP_.	Hopeful that someone would tell her that her life didn 't have to end on her twenty-seventh birthday .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Today you 're going to learn to deal with the bookkeeping software .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	""" Would you ... would you lie here with me ?"
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The only other person I could turn to for help was Dr. Boggs , maybe he would know something .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe he would not worry about them at all .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She had to look innocent or he 'd never let her go .
tr	NP_VP_.	Not a care in the world those girls , either that or they hid their fear well .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had this happened ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Everything suddenly felt turned on its head .
tr	NP_VP_.	She seemed to be taking particular exception to that spectacular ass .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Slashed my machete at the bus driver I think I cut off his hand .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he lay back and tucked her against his side .
tr	NP_VP_.	She hunkered down and eyed Bliss with distrust .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now all he wanted was to keep her close .
tr	VP_.	Don 't want you to get complacent .
tr	VP_.	Waiting outside Seth 's frat house .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So he was a vampire .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What else was I supposed to do ?
tr	NP_VP_.	She bent her knees and sank down until her thighs touched her calves .
tr	NP_PP_.	My bed with its purple and gray comforter and plump pillows .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'd accepted the job .
tr	OTHER	But it still doesn 't explain why I 'm changing .
tr	OTHER	The water was so cold , she could no longer feel her feet , but it helped to clear her head somewhat .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	How many other facts haven 't you told him ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Before I forget that breeding is a bad idea for a Huntress .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When blood was all they had around them .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he rose , held out a hand and helped her to the bedroom , where they could both stretch out .
tr	VP_.	Mysteriously showing up at school .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For a terrible moment she was afraid they 'd make her kill him like a cat and shove his body to the beasts .
tr	S_CC_S_.	I felt wetter still between my thighs and it horrified me .
tr	OTHER	Could it be something to do with her famous father ?
tr	NP_PP_.	""" Madness "" by Muse ."
tr	NP_VP_.	Half a hockey team boarded at the next stop .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	The agreement was always for whomever I married to take over as laird of our clan .
tr	VP_.	said Ellen , hopefully .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I asked the bastard why he didn 't bring you to dinner .
tr	VP_.	Speak of the damn devil .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	Which one doesn 't matter .
tr	VP_.	comes a soft voice from behind me .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course I have no way of knowing if that is just the drink or the droplet which has made it that way .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But this she could manage .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Anyone will tell you I don 't have a jealous bone in my body .
tr	NP_VP_.	I freshened up my make-up while I waited for Drew , trying to muster some enthusiasm for the date .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	At length Gandalf spoke .
tr	S_CC_S_.	She was guarded and brief and her last name was simply too exotic to be real .
tr	OTHER	Was his discipline too severe ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you see him ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where do we live ?
tr	VP_.	Ever heard of it ?
tr	OTHER	But Carlos never expected I would hate it in Florida .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The heater kicked in and the fan blew hard .
tr	S_VP_.	Do not fool yourself into thinking my son cares about you .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before it disappeared completely the boy turned and maybe waved me goodbye as I opened my eyes and found myself back in the diner .
tr	NP_PP_.	No way in the world .
tr	VP_.	Don 't give me that look .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have any clue what she was doing to me ?
tr	OTHER	twisting her bare back to me then says sideways to Rann .
tr	S_CC_S_.	My mom and I locked eyes for a second and I knew she wouldn 't tell any compromising stories .
tr	OTHER	Never Do Important Things While Drunk I dragged James out to the street .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And some of them were Reapers of Chaos ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he left his canoe , walked in among the trees .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In most cases they dumped him rather than vice versa .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	It was either that or they all decided to dye their hair , which I found annoying .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he want to kill me before and suddenly change his mind ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The horror of this , to be utterly unconnected ... .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I replaced the hinges , and oiled the leather and made it travel worthy .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Ruby 's eyebrows rose and I could tell I had surprised her .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Although he totally got what she did now too , and why she 'd gone this new route with her life .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he deny it to his son ?
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she 'd hold him and enjoy him while she could .
tr	S_VP_.	Hank : Just tell me where the hell we 're going .
tr	OTHER	But wasn 't the truth that some mistakes were so big that they couldn 't be undone ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	After that I chose the little wieners wrapped in croissants , the macaroni salad , graham crackers , and cherry tomatoes .
tr	NP_VP_.	The signet ring , bearing his law school crest , was the only jewelry her father had ever worn other than his wedding band .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	If he could locate her worthless roommate , he 'd make her pay for every bit of pain Kara was suffering right now .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Just because two people can dance well on a stage to prearranged choreography doesn 't guarantee that they will be good partners in a simple slow dance .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I folded up the map and decided to check it out .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Jake wasn 't easily provoked , especially since it was him I was making out with on a daily basis .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How will we hoist her up onto the roof ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really want to keep chasing Kate when she didn 't want to be caught ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But there was something weird about interrogating prisoners .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	In fact I preferred waiting to see how these events would unfold .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	You 'd think by now he would realize that he 's in way over his head with me .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But these animals stood about four feet six inches tall .
tr	S_VP_.	Talking about Audrey was reminding me of the guy who 'd tried to kill me today .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we 'd just have to figure out how to live in opposite corners of Missoula County .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't she keep a man ?
tr	NP_PP_.	The first of many .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The moment we came off the dance floor he was eating you up .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did it not surprise her that he 'd bring up the threat of litigation if she tried to get out of it ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What else have you got in there ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	Carl queried and I was happy he didn 't have Nate 's last name , not that any of us always needed that important information .
tr	OTHER	This time she had Linda 's arm and she gave it a yank , keeping her tone friendly and concerned .
tr	NP_VP_.	There were shadows lurking in her best friend 's eyes she 'd never glimpsed before .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But we are not inhumane .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Goosebumps form wherever his lips touch and I shiver from the sheer pleasure of it .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On the fortieth day his embalmed body was placed in a sarcophagus within the tomb that 's construction began the day he became King .
tr	NP_PP_.	The stained-glass window in the back .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly the noise from the doorbell stopped .
tr	S_CC_S_.	Keno nodded and Murray moved quickly along the corridor to the great staircase .
tr	S_VP_.	Weeping willow trees surrounded the edges of the sloping lawn almost as in protection .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least it worked out .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So we wouldn 't go home .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He then walked over to the bottle of Pierre on the coffee table and carefully grasped it by the very tip of the neck .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had Nicole ever gotten comfortable in this place dripping with money ?
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	His persistence finally resulted in the concession to entertain the men at the embarkation points .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The security light in the parking lot to the rear of the apartment building also benefited my backyard , at least a little .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I gathered as much energy as I could , no doubt chilling the air around me , and pressed the activation button on the machine .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I drew in a breath and started to dig my way out of my tomb .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Seeing Tench he stood up .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then someone quietly cleared his throat to gain her attention .
tr	OTHER	Can you keep a secret ?
tr	S_CC_S_.	I pulled my fist free from his skull and he buckled to the floor .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she saw Jennifer looking toward the door .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So I asked the ladies if they wanted to take on this additional request .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So that 's what he did .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He was using every ounce of restraint he had to keep from thrusting into her .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	He tucked one in his belt and the other he pointed at the nearest deputy .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did she even say it ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	How many times had he heard Arnie ask for trust ?
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whether you got a good deal or not is anybody 's guess .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean the boy in front of me now ?
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What was the need to slaughter their bodies ?
tr	VP_.	Let him be embraced by your family .
tr	NP_VP_.	Liz released a breath and willed her heart to slow .
tr	NP_PP_.	One of the kids !
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she would thin out so that the light and food would just pass through her .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The man she loved with all her heart .
tr	OTHER	one woman band that could proudly do it all !
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He immediately buried his face in my neck .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That she 'd threatened Rusty .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she hung up and turned into Rosewood Day .
tr	OTHER	But as long as you keep going to school I don 't think even near fatal pneumonia could keep me from showing up just to see you .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Amelia soon found herself standing on a cliff overlooking the ocean , surrounded by wildflowers in full , rainbow-colored bloom .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Although , to be fair , Ethan and Autumn had stood by them the whole time , and Lisa was their number one fan .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As though my worrying and missing him had been poured into the song and so lifted out of me .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The crime scene he had just helped to analyze .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like they dropped down from the sky .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But first he had to escape this one or be sent into oblivion .
tr	OTHER	And if one strained they might just have been able to make out the sounds of the immense marketplace .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That it would never be proven was also of no doubt .
tr	S_VP_.	Turns out he wasn 't such a kind , nice man , after all .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	That I 'd like to know why I died .
tr	OTHER	Or imagine that somebody gets sick .
tr	S_CC_S_.	The door opened and Pigeon climbed in .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he decided he must have been mistaken , because she immediately appeared to be as cool , calm , and collected as always .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	What he did notice was just how badly his hands were shaking , not from fear but from trepidation .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Folklore mention anything to you about going to see Doc .
tr	OTHER	Every muscle in his face was tense , his mouth opened and closed as though yelling , but no noise came out .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Down at mouth I plodded off to find Thomas .
tr	OTHER	Not when her heart was still recovering from Steve .
tr	WHNP_SQ_.	What does he see when he looks in the water ?
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	And the other thing was and the piloting maneuver into the Pentagon .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I heard his mean laughter .
tr	VP_.	Find out what time Mr. Hunter was last seen alive and so on .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Once it had been like looking into a disturbed anthill .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did it mean Sebastian would 've shot him ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even before I heard Momma 's tone of voice the pit of my stomach was churning .
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	When do you stop expanding an empire ?
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	The whole time I was screaming and crying .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	As if I could be so lucky .
tr	NP_PP_.	Almost word by word .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Figured I had time .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now there was Milos .
tr	OTHER	And he gave me a very specific look , letting me know that my boys needed their sleep and I should leave well enough alone .
tr	CC_NP_VP_.	But he could play one , for now .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Not even a strand of her hair moved , even though she could clearly see the effects of the powerful blast of air gusting about her .
tr	NP_PP_.	Jack as a wolf .
tr	S_VP_.	Being compelled against one 's will is something even the smallest beast that crawls would rail against .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	A few seconds later it swung open to reveal the band 's nearly nak * d bass player .
tr	OTHER	Can I get up now ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that make it more meaningful ?
tr	WHADVP_SQ_.	Lise where did you get this ?
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have some kind of bad childhood memory about missing a flight ?
tr	S_NP_VP_.	Taking him up and over with the strongest , sweetest climax he 'd ever experienced .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Lowe even winked at me to let me know everything was all right between us .
tr	NP_VP_.	Some spoke of Heart Stones beneath Dark Fist , saying the hearts were what powered the Walls of the World .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So you drove away without even trying to get a good look at her .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	17 One second she was sound asleep , the next she was vaulting to consciousness , fully alert , certain that something was wrong .
tr	S_VP_.	Seeing the photo again now is just as hard as it was back then .
tr	S_VP_.	Being the Gerard imbued me with a strength and skill that only continued to grow .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The way my neck creaked and cracked really did give testimony to the fact that maybe I should look into getting a bed for the place .
tr	OTHER	And then he vanished into the dining hall .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was that really supposed to be the secret behind the secret ?
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I had been a little high strung all evening .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	"Keeping her voice calm , "" You are the master "" she replied ."
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	For Jake Carver it had proved an emotional journey further than he could have ever imagined .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	This time she made sure her challenge was light and fun .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So McKenzie was just fine .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But instead she found him with another girl .
tr	S_VP_.	turning herself suitably so he could give what her body required .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	With a groan it tipped , slowly at first .
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If it 'll hurt when they get inside my head .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	After she danced at her eldest son 's wedding , of course .
tr	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He just knew that it would be with him all his days .
tr	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Already she could hear a significant accent .
tr	NP_PP_.	' Out of order ?
tr	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you loved Eye Candy ( or even if you didn 't ) I would really appreciate a review .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	That this moment won 't end the way last night did , with me screaming and terrified of the specters from my past .
tr	IN_NP_VP_.	So she spoke , and spoke with confidence .
tr	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he manipulating her again ?
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	Like a toy that anyone could have made .
tr	PP_NP_VP_.	On Lauren 's arrival she 'd discovered it was in worse condition than she 'd anticipated .
tr	NP_PP_.	Another of her kindnesses , for which I 've always been thankful .
tr	S_NP_VP_.	This may be his nature or the fact he doesn 't want to lose the bet to Courtney .
tr	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he is gone .
tr	NP_NP_VP_.	Every instinct he had told him to stay .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the van seemed to leap and go rocketing downward .
tr	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever urge Thibault might have had to press further was contained by the sight of Ben walking toward the porch .
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she turned it over .
tr	NP_PP_.	Thinking such thoughts at a time like this ?
tr	RB_NP_VP_.	Only Ethan seemed unaffected by it all .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course it was Calliope !
va	VP_.	See you later , alligator !
va	NP_NP_VP_.	The only things I could count on .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I heard words that would change my life .
va	S_NP_VP_.	She squatted down and touched the rock with one finger , quickly , in case it was hot .
va	S_VP_.	Focusing my eyes was far more challenging than it should have been .
va	S_CC_S_.	Chloe hoped the blush on her face and the thumping of her heart wasn 't too noticeable to the older Were .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now I knew it was the only place I wanted to be .
va	NP_PP_.	The corners of her mouth .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do you do that ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	Ronan sought out the new life , needing to reassure himself it was safe .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Peter have any idea how sweet he was ?
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he have been such a fool ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He never tried to tame her .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What I did know was that he 'd attuned himself to me .
va	VP_.	Leave a note if you want to .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What he did know was that he should have told Melanie Parker some of this .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So you don 't have time for a bite .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now we know that we can bring peace to society .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Then one of our guys gets sick on the bus ride back home .
va	S_NP_VP_.	Victoria leveled a gaze at her that was equal parts how are we friends and are you sure you 're female ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I still couldn 't quite accept that she was my sister .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	All at once she was laughing .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he blame me for Demetri 's freak out ?
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I supposed to use the rock ?
va	NP_VP_.	His right leg was throbbing .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then he returned to Levi 's side .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Why it should please me to be defying my mother was a mystery .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Not on our soil was the new American credo .
va	NP_PP_.	Queen Maureen of the night .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did his dirty leather shoes not have holes ?
va	OTHER	And what do you mean I 'm on your side ?
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How am I going to find what I 'm looking for if the nightmares on the doorstep are ready to eat me ?
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When Roger started to lean back Bloom grabbed him and pulled him forward .
va	VP_.	Wasn 't a rotted corpse .
va	VP_.	Feel the fear and use it !
va	OTHER	Was that the right word ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	That I 'd do anything to fix it .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Along with other law enforcement related questions .
va	S_NP_VP_.	It wasn 't what he 'd expected .
va	S_CC_S_.	I shrugged and my face went a bit pink .
va	S_CC_S_.	"I ate another strawberry and she cried out , "" Cin , come now , do not toy with me so !"
va	PP_NP_VP_.	To him the light must be a spectacular distraction .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What did that mean ?
va	VP_.	Get in or get off .
va	NP_VP_.	It took two officers to force her to walk toward the paddy wagon and another to shove her into the back .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	One day you will share everything with him .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so she turned for her own hut .
va	NP_PP_.	' Nothing in particular .
va	VP_.	Heating up the focaccia ?
va	NP_PP_.	""" Little ball of metal and glass ."
va	PP_NP_VP_.	By bumping the inside of a tumbler lock Ant could force the pins up above the lock for a fraction of a second .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he like ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely she wasn 't hearing things .
va	S_VP_.	Grabbing the stone was like trying to grab a shadow .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	The one he had seen before , in the Park Lane Hilton .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Without stopping he grasped the spike that pinned his left arm and ripped it from the giant bone .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the youngster huddled in the back of the cage , whimpering .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We ´ re here .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Except this was a different kind of blistering provoked by a maddening rush of emotions .
va	S_CC_S_.	I actually believed you were different but you 're not .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They just don 't really like flying at night .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	After thinking it through he felt like he could continue so he drafted another note to Darren and sent it off .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I felt pain .
va	VP_.	Can 't sit in this room all day .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But she would feel better eventually .
va	NP_PP_.	This time of night ?
va	SBAR_VP_.	What continued to play out bore more resemblance to a disaster movie than it did to what had really happened .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What did they see when they looked at me ?
va	NP_PP_.	The softness of her skin .
va	NP_PP_.	A pause of awkward silence .
va	S_CC_S_.	My wolf managed to tear a small patch of clarity open in my mind and I sucked in another gulp of air as quickly as I could .
va	NP_VP_.	She could see that they all understood .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What could a mere human do against a power such as Ship ?
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she immediately gave him her back .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why ever would you think that ?
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did nobody guess the truth ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe one night would satiate my need and free me , just as Jackson suggested .
va	SBAR_VP_.	When he didn 't answer Tara went on .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once he claimed a woman for his own there was no way he 'd let her out of his sight for any length of time .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there was that lady .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'd say ' worms ' has returned as the favourite .
va	SBAR_VP_.	After he retired his son challenged him to write a book .
va	S_VP_.	Remembering the words of the old lady that everything that happens does so for a reason had given her some kind of comfort .
va	NP_PP_.	Three out of three .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	This time her response sent fingers playing over his skin , touching him intimately , heating his body .
va	S_CC_S_.	The apparition disappeared and the hologram apparatus descended back into the floor .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I got out to the street I noticed there were cars from the same era parked against the curb .
va	S_NP_VP_.	I took a step towards Will , already bringing my arm back for the strike I was committed to .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What was important in dancing ?
va	NP_VP_.	I pointed at the bus .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What I don 't get is why everyone is so worried .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it hit me like a bolt of lightning .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	When did other people 's opinions of me start to matter so much ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He only had a push or two left , and was out of fire , ice , and thunder as well .
va	S_NP_VP_.	""" And look what else , "" she said , and showed him the seeds of hope she had in her pocket ."
va	NP_PP_.	All because of that vampire .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now that you have left your homeland you will soon find others who have been changed as you have been .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And I thought about wolves who didn 't act like wolves .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she look defeated ?
va	VP_.	Keep an open mind .
va	S_NP_VP_.	Dwelling place of the worst criminals the Four Systems possessed .
va	NP_PP_.	A respite from the bitterness that had left his own heart so hard .
va	NP_VP_.	Karen nodded , too overwhelmed to speak .
va	OTHER	Just like the princess who pricked her finger on a spindle .
va	OTHER	What if her encounter with César at a Second Street café hadn 't been happenstance , but part of a plot ?
va	S_VP_.	Waiting for her gave us time to plan strategy .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	That he could do with no problem .
va	NP_PP_.	City of Heroes if the property of NC Soft and all rights belong to them .
va	NP_VP_.	Alix patted the other girl 's shoulder .
va	S_CC_S_.	I knew I had to stop the bleeding before I moved anywhere and I reached into my bag , pulling out the field dressing .
va	NP_PP_.	a sort of inbred homegrown soul .
va	S_VP_.	Seeing his parents again still had the sheen of unreality .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	That she doesn 't want me .
va	S_CC_S_.	The branch snapped and he fell to the ground .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Because being around me gave them something .
va	VP_.	Not without all of them and a whole lot of other people getting hurt in the process .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was she being singled out again ?
va	NP_PP_.	ON PLANET ON BUSINESS .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon Sean is back by my side .
va	NP_VP_.	She worked the hardest at trying to keep the young woman 's spirit up .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had James turned to this woman years ago ?
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I moved on , reminding myself not to forget to move back .
va	OTHER	Have you seen this bedroom ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	"Day One "" I 'm so glad I caught you , Esther ."
va	OTHER	And how well did I really know Will , anyway ?
va	SBAR_VP_.	When she and Jake made love they shared some kind of psychic connection .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Maybe tomorrow we can go for a ride .
va	NP_VP_.	Tears were flowing down Lea 's cheeks .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What I do know in each case was they had shifters for mothers .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	That I 've never met the man , but Dad seems to think he 's wonderful .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	That evening Silken did not leave Suave 's side .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And behind it is not a faint streak of a tail like those you see in textbooks .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So he ducked the question and left the club for his office earlier than he usually did .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So everything was going fine until the afternoon of the Ball .
va	NP_PP_.	A hunter of prey .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever dumped his body in the hatch meant to type the code and open the outer door , sending the body out into the vacuum of space .
va	OTHER	No matter what some may say .
va	SBAR_VP_.	If it ventures near I will attack .
va	NP_VP_.	He 's more apt to lick you to death than anything else .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As she talked she moved into position .
va	OTHER	Maybe they just weren 't meant to be .
va	S_CC_S_.	He felt her stiffen as they were pushed back in their seats and the speedometer quickly hit 150 and kept climbing .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If the legends are true then it can restore my strength and your youth , maybe forever .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it rude , to just order him around ?
va	S_CC_S_.	I place a hand on his cheek and his stubble is rough against my palm .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And open the package Mom told me to burn .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So that means I have to keep going .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was a promise that someday he would spend a night with her , followed by many other nights .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because she doesn 't sleep with every guy that blinks at her ?
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why wasn 't she talking back to him ?
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there were the Butchers .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	A feeling he believed he 'd grown out of , since he started playing with the big boys at least .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I should go find a time machine and be a pirate ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Some days I don 't even see the point in getting out of my bunk because I 'm not going anywhere .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then a voice cried from the window , "" He 's in the side yard !"
va	NP_PP_.	No point in watching it , really .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As they walked through the main entrance it was always the same .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least she 'd stopped screaming .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What the hell was she thinking ?
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"Before Psyche was out of her fever they were back at our gates crying , "" Corn , corn !"
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she woke up enough to look at the clock , only to discover no red digital numbers were in their accustomed place .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So she got up feeling pissy .
va	S_VP_.	Carving useless objects out of wood is a strange , stupid , pointless habit .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	One time he 'd even been chased by a hammerhead shark and was forced to take cover in the wreck he 'd been exploring .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	One of the things I do best .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he actually proud to be marrying her ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	One word just kept repeating in my head .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because we need your help to make things right .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Next moment the rumbling quaking her bones intensified as his fingers traced the spots where the patterns made up of his name clustered .
va	VP_.	Doesn 't seem to help .
va	NP_VP_.	The narrow path wound in and out of the forest .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And you take your fill of me .
va	VP_.	To ask you to do that .
va	S_VP_.	Maybe studying on my bed hadn 't been the best idea .
va	NP_PP_.	Me in a club ?
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she think Kylie was back to being a werewolf now ?
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then Donovan wasn 't someone who shielded his thoughts or his emotions .
va	S_CC_S_.	The whimpering ceased and Franz tensed up .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But he didn 't stop there .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What little support they had been able to raise came from volunteers still trickling in from the United States of America .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What did it mean for him to be checking up on her ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She just hoped nothing was going to happen to this amethyst .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What am I saying ?
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So he sat there , slack-jawed and silent .
va	NP_VP_.	They don 't have specific nights dedicated to them .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So Laurel and Emma had spent most of the day in the kitchen , baking cookies and flipping through magazines .
va	OTHER	And to mourn him showed our connection .
va	OTHER	Everyone he 'd killed , laid out like dolls .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did he do that ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly he wanted to .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she feel the weight of justice on his side ?
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But Zamir proved resilient , pivoting with a roundhouse kick to Fitzgerald 's ribs .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If Garrison 's hired guns actually managed to kill her he would be content .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I need the good Russian citizens to stand up and stop this needless killing of innocent people .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I went and took the grill .
va	S_VP_.	Grab the phone numbers you really want and get your ass back to the set or Dad 's going to ground you .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And the children were even more susceptible .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you get a pair of shoes ?
va	NP_VP_.	The floor was covered in round ice pods , also very unusual .
va	S_VP_.	Hanging from nails which had been hammered in above the door frame were several small figures .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why should you be stuck here , playing nursemaid for the rest of your life ?
va	NP_VP_.	I was enjoying our banter more than I had enjoyed anything in a long while .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where was the sense of accomplishment ?
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so I took my weeping daughter out of the doomed city .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she waddled over and kissed me .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you think he wanted anything more than a casual screw ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	Dating Mark under the constant threat of having my job taken away if I did something he didn 't like .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	Who the hell is this ?
va	OTHER	Like several iron manacles bolted to the wall .
va	NP_PP_.	The son of a bitch .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't I hear it from you ?
va	S_VP_.	Resisting his charms for the next six months might prove harder than she 'd anticipated .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	On every wall there hung the antlers , horns and skins of many different beasts , including the brilliant white fur of a great wolf .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But I couldn 't shrug it off .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I seriously standing here debating over the flavor of Gatorade for some chick ?
va	PP_NP_VP_.	In New Zealand the news of the Australian successes were met with hope that their plight would end also .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	While the video played he looked at a picture of Frost he had on his desk .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least she didn 't have to be on the run .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They all had a different complexion and came from different parts of the world .
va	OTHER	Please say that wasn 't the case .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she really intend to use her salary to pay off her mother 's medical bills ?
va	OTHER	Not severe as he 'd promised .
va	OTHER	Was she making that low keening sound ?
va	SBAR_VP_.	Not because I want to make amends with him .
va	VP_.	Crying quietly with the TV on , as if she couldn 't even find the effort to get up .
va	S_CC_S_.	The door to one is hanging wide open and the white tiles are bathed in blood ... Olivia 's blood .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Seconds later she received a message saying that the phone line had been disconnected .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	A few moments later the same thing happened again .
va	S_NP_VP_.	Maybe together they could fulfill a prophecy , one he would love to come true .
va	S_CC_S_.	We moved in and everyone got slaughtered .
va	OTHER	It looked like two king size beds had been put together and then a massive headboard in the shape of a large crown sat at the top .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he walked into my vision and through the flapping doors .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How are things there ?
va	S_CC_S_.	It would go west , down a bit then climb right onto the mountain and there was enough width except at the bald mountaintop .
va	S_NP_VP_.	But then I usually lose focus and find myself wondering when or if Mary will return to me .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	Who the hell is this ?
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Amelia even want to be here ?
va	NP_PP_.	The glare of the sun .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she 'd opened the damn door !
va	S_NP_VP_.	Chase had told her he wasn 't going to give up .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he looked at Doyle .
va	S_CC_S_.	Although it was tough to see her eyes , with her lashes closed and her head thrown back in pleasure .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now the refugee started to move again back to the shore .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 26 I sprinted out of the prison and back up the many flights of stairs .
va	NP_PP_.	Expectations of their relationship ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It just so happened that they used my connection to get themselves in there without getting spotted .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they attempted to assassinate me .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Since neither of them had any particular advantage - either in size or weaponry - this promised to be a very interesting duel .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What are you afraid of , being loved ?
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he looks at his brother and adds : Some of us .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she remembered her grandfather 's keys , pulled them out of her pocket , and held them out to her dad .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	The same book he 'd been trying to read for the past month .
va	S_VP_.	Being the focus of intimately detailed perceptions that were coming from someone she really didn 't know was just plain creepy .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And you know how I feel about plenty of kitchen counter space .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	At any rate I suppose we have no choice but to ascend by these means , as I see no other road leading upwards .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So Adam pondered this and said : Uh , whut kin I git fer just a rib ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	he asked , feeling a bit protective in case the answer was no .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why should she look for help she didn 't need ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now all he had to worry about was if she was pregnant .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	A tone she didn 't much appreciate .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	The only thing she wanted to think about .
va	NP_PP_.	No nervous clearing of throats , no uneasy laughter .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What was that infuriating sound ?
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But he 'd never raised a hand to one unless she 'd hurt someone else first .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If we keep the buttons done up on our jackets maybe He won 't .
va	VP_.	Hell if he didn 't admire her all over again .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then another part was still convinced yesterday was either a joke or he had realized she was the wrong choice .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Obviously he didn 't like needles any more than she did .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	Or was it a members-only thing ?
va	VP_.	Can 't imagine where my brain had went .
va	VP_.	Hurt pretty bad , as always .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	A pout he wanted to kiss away .
va	NP_VP_.	He slid it from her .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	After Jonathan told me the truth he tried to force me to do things that Dave wanted .
va	NP_PP_.	My tender body in other words .
va	S_NP_VP_.	Drawing in a deep breath she let it out slowly .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What we 've built is too good to allow Satan to destroy it .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But the General rose to his feet .
va	NP_VP_.	Chad snored softly close to her ear .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	This time they took a different path , the four of them herded swiftly along like so many sheep .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Unless he accidently killed her , of course .
va	S_VP_.	Finding her was not that hard .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was nowhere to be found .
va	S_VP_.	Give and take will not work with you and I if your goal is to only save your friends .
va	S_CC_S_.	Jericho sat across the semi-circle from me and I noticed a glance from him about every five seconds .
va	NP_PP_.	More than that , perhaps .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Since a tall brick wall stands between the compound and the outside world .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I offered her my jacket .
va	S_VP_.	Doing the handshake made me feel like somebody valued me enough to do a secret handshake with me .
va	S_VP_.	"Says he "" He 's O.K. "" No word of where he came from ."
va	S_NP_VP_.	We have a hard time believing in anything we can 't see .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	This time she could be sure that the emotional foundation was for real , not just a byproduct of the psychic link .
va	S_CC_S_.	They weren 't sure what was in the rain at the moment but the puddles left yellow stains on the ground when they dried up .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And still her hands shook .
va	VP_.	To take it between her teeth and tug .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So he knew about our conversion experiment .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just realized , I ' m the only one without a weapon .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What had I done to get him so excited ?
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did I answer that ?
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But he started it because of me .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It kind of seemed like she was always disappointed in me .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So we sit side by side , staring at the water , in silence .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So the special Watcher had a name after all .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or at least it will be at midnight tomorrow tonight .
va	NP_PP_.	yelled Alexander to Gaspar who was close by .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I suddenly realized Mark was saying something to me .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though her body became ragdoll limp in his arms her dress rose as she wrapped a leg around him .
va	S_CC_S_.	He kissed her tenderly and thoroughly till she grew comfortably relaxed with him , warm and pliant .
va	VP_.	Thank the stars all his meetings were not that unpleasant .
va	SBAR_VP_.	If they had wondered what he was doing too .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then Zach 's mother raised up her arms and jumped , diving into the waters below .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would I need to know something so trivial ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	A world that was foreign and a world I wanted to make my home .
va	VP_.	Go hide in an alley and starve to death ?
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did a demon who seared anything he touched need a coat ?
va	S_CC_S_.	Chuck had spent two years working for a rail company before starting his first degree and he 'd used thermite to weld dozens of rails together .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How you gon na get through the Mexican lines ?
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he watched for the rise and fall of her chest once more before beginning again .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I tried again .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though she doubted Google would have anything on that .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it dawned on me .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So Brett stared into green eyes spitting fire right back at him .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	"Candice tentatively began : "" When I married your father he told me he worked on a merchant ship ."
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I now have spittle on my door frame .
va	OTHER	And that alone was worth its weight in gold .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I was looking into that gaping black hole from where a bullet would emerge and kill me .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was there a roaring in his ears ?
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So she exhaled and placed her hand inside of his .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's that supposed to mean ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I never even talk to them .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	For several moments the grief and guilt he 'd locked away swelled out of the sealed compartment in his mind .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Now as he lay physically satiated beside Verity he found himself questioning what had not been evident during the passionate interlude that had just taken place .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would she be texting me ?
va	SBAR_VP_.	Though I don 't think she was meant ta be no mamma .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So she settled back to read .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had he managed to keep his hold on the boy through all that ?
va	S_CC_S_.	No strategy was discussed and the only thing that was decided was the night club they would be rockin ' after the game .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How would he be watching me ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	The air is crisper the farther from the fire I get .
va	S_VP_.	Feeling me of observed hit I turned me .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So she crept toward that room .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she made her way downstairs , back into the hidden vault through the concealed passage , making sure to close everything behind her .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you didn 't I don 't know what I 'd do .
va	NP_PP_.	A year of living together day by day , while he shrank .
va	VP_.	Take Stacy Sullivan , the waitress at Hub 's , for instance .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But still she forged ahead .
va	S_NP_VP_.	It seems obvious to me they would try to find a boat and ease out in the dark .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	This morning there was a layer of frost on everything .
va	OTHER	But how silly of you to believe you had a special power .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where will we live ?
va	NP_VP_.	She stifled a delighted moan .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Behind a row of muddy Wellington boots Reacher could see the glint of black metal .
va	S_NP_VP_.	"Rumor had it he was making "" idle threats "" to anyone who was thinking about taking their business from Ed to Logan Caplin ."
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then they turned into mine when I finally couldn 't take it anymore and got the hell out of the house .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How dare that bastard attack Savannah ?
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When we turned I could see the three of them in the distance .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I wish I had a boat .
va	NP_PP_.	A couple of months ?
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't I know ?
va	NP_PP_.	Lots of restaurants , discos , a comedy club , lounges and bars .
va	VP_.	Look at how they are treating us !
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But she deserved the praise .
va	NP_PP_.	Depends on what you 're being protected from .
va	NP_VP_.	She stared at him nervously until he grinned .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I want to start all over , slowly , taking my time getting to know every inch of you .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he even know ?
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I stepped out of my car to check into the same dilapidated motel two men dressed black suits and dark sunglasses approached me .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What did he do to deserve this ?
va	PP_NP_VP_.	As a Kinetic trains his or her reservoir of energy in their body grows .
va	S_VP_.	Being doorman wasn 't that great , until the door opened and in walked Miss Beautiful .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I see anyone with the Red Death ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	One moment she looked adorable , the next she was shoving him out of the way and racing towards the bathroom .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So he did not like misconceptions ?
va	S_VP_.	Getting out of her wheelchair took great effort .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he realized he had the black crystal clutched tightly in his palm , his knuckles white .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So that left me and Julianna .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you get bitten when you were a kid or something ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	The ones Sir Walter Erle commanded were mainly from a troop of volunteers he himself had raised and trained and armed properly with pikes and muskets .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	People still had a tendency to disappear in this former Soviet Bloc country , where corruption continued to run rampant .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then you know my nephew , George Deere ?
va	NP_VP_.	Two sickly chickens scratching in the dirt .
va	S_VP_.	Looking at her hurt .
va	S_NP_VP_.	It was pandemonium as Ms. Cope from the front office and Mr. Varner the math teacher tried to line everyone up alphabetically .
va	NP_PP_.	Good entertainment on winter nights .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And it 's my job to figure out what happened , who did it .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Meanwhile Sylvie was looking at her watch and remarking at how late it was -- and asking where had the afternoon gone ?
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she 'd show her again .
va	NP_VP_.	Sean mashes his mouth shut and looks back and forth before leaning forward and blasting me .
va	S_NP_VP_.	I surged forward and shone the light on his desk , looking for something I could take .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Fighting the cold had sapped her strength .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would you even say that ?
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could a human do this to another human ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	That little story didn 't seem like one I should share with Adam .
va	SBAR_VP_.	When this is all finished .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They simply continued to our table as if nothing had happened .
va	S_VP_.	Looking at Sutton 's dead body was like looking at pictures of herself dead .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But my question was more directed to the underlying root or principle of your unwillingness to become more acquainted with your mother .
va	S_CC_S_.	Now it had vanished into the back of the front seat and Michael Curry had turned and was peering past Yuri , right into Ash 's eyes .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I can wait .
va	NP_PP_.	My own share of rumors ?
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But the fact that Sebastian had commanded me to do it made it much more alluring .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Unfortunately Carrie wasn 't home .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he give us a single thought ?
va	SBAR_VP_.	When she 'd finished laughing Alexandra moved on to more serious business .
va	NP_VP_.	Nick shrugged his shoulder where Quentin 's hand had just been .
va	NP_VP_.	the girl spits viciously .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What had she expected ?
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But she doesn 't say anything to me because I never say anything to her about her caramel macchiato addiction .
va	S_NP_VP_.	She decided to wait until they reached the airport to ask for the explanations he 'd promised her .
va	S_VP_.	' Don 't move , ' said Toby , kneeling beside him .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And that tells me all I need to know .
va	OTHER	No , he was a cobra , said others .
va	VP_.	Heard the torpedoes click into the firing tubes .
va	NP_PP_.	Study for a PhD ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it didn 't matter what a coward she could be so long as he liked her body .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	"So that 's why you bit me , "" she concluded softly , her voice husky and quiet in the dying night ."
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So much could be bartered and exchanged .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	That he didn 't need a male child ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	Beth pumped her legs as she followed the TED in front of her , the entire group retreating further down the path they 'd been following .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He still thought the best plan would have been for him to just seize control of the shapeshifter , telepathically , then let the soldiers capture it .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I should stay like this for touchdown .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would you leave when you feel that we belong ?
va	SBAR_VP_.	If she could believe the woman wasn 't human , then the same applied to Sebastian .
va	VP_.	Continue preparing the ship for departure .
va	S_VP_.	Being a Hunter was not bad at all .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So the three finished the bottle while engaging in discussions of what happened in the year 1861 or around that time .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where have they gone ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The paint immediately starts to blister and peel away .
va	S_NP_VP_.	Don 't tell me you 've given up already and checked into a hotel .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then all she felt was dread , because she 'd won .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So Sawyer had come here to make good on his promises .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What happened to a king when he was forced to battle with his queen ?
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But this woman might have heard the struggle , the crashing dishes , might have been listening from the hall for some time .
va	S_CC_S_.	Nash barely tolerated Dare right now and nobody held a grudge like his middle brother .
va	S_CC_S_.	He continued to spank the globes of my ass and I remembered how the pleasure of that burn excited me .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What Rock had revealed didn 't change my feelings for him one bit .
va	S_NP_VP_.	Kissed the woman he loved .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the clerk told me I choked , my eyes bugging out of my head in shock .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	A year ago I wouldn 't have been intimidated by black and white ink , by signatures and dotted lines .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Except at first glance most of the houses were gone .
va	S_VP_.	For you all to be so well acquainted is unprecedented .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But sleep eluded me .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Half the time I don 't even think he did it to be cruel .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Why my kneecaps I couldn 't tell you .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If it was true that Logan and Keith had met before , why hadn 't Logan said anything ?
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why is the fight just happening now ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	A couple of kids he 'd only seen a handful of times .
va	S_CC_S_.	The wind whipped her hair into her face and he gently pushed it back behind her ear .
va	NP_VP_.	He was my uncle and Edan 's younger brother .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	You just had to like the honesty .
va	NP_VP_.	"Asha shouted in his face , "" Tell me !"
va	S_NP_VP_.	"Amy added , "" Jake would you like to earn some money mowing our lawn tomorrow ."
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Past countless trees they went , his captor showing no intention of slowing .
va	VP_.	Catch the first stage out of town , and don 't look back .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He still did not speak nor did he tear his dark brown eyes from mine .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What you don 't do is direct and manipulate them into being what you want , envision , or need .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sounds an aural shield could have politely hidden if she hadn 't wanted anyone to hear .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What good is it if everything we know will fade ?
va	NP_PP_.	Four out of ten .
va	OTHER	""" Oh yeah , baby , "" she groaned , her h * ps shifting restlessly , driving me wild ."
va	PP_NP_VP_.	With minutes the edible contents of the kitchen were being carried , box by box , and barrel by barrel , down to the beach .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course I care , you stupid idiot .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	Who else would fight for justice ?
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before she could move again he made his move .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Fila only hesitated a moment .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Then with a deafening screech the board and the rider flew straight into the left hand jet engine of the plane .
va	NP_PP_.	Crazy son of a bitch .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But that did not matter .
va	OTHER	Would they mock his body ?
va	S_VP_.	Being with him would be the highlight , the sweetest part of a life that would always be filled with danger .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly the ground bucked under them .
va	OTHER	But when my head steadied I found myself teetering on the edge of the entrance .
va	NP_PP_.	Her life for theirs .
va	SBAR_VP_.	While I 'd never suspected Alcide , of course someone had made the Were into a body .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Things he had described in brutal detail .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So the tide of public opinion has turned .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least he wasn 't married .
va	S_CC_S_.	The phone rang and she answered it , surprised to see Teagan Mishkin 's name on the screen .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did you bloody well leave it in a manila packet tucked into the U bend of the toilet ?
va	OTHER	The one who still loved me .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How in the world did they go about finding someone who obviously didn 't want to be with the person she was supposed to be with ?
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What in the name of all the deities had Pagan 's mother done ?
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Until she had at last looked up into his face and had seen he was in agony .
va	NP_PP_.	Most of all herself .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even in the meager sunlight , what lay inside the skull glinted brightly .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she drew a heart around it .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe Oberon would come through for me after all .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Whoever checked this Gant in must have gotten a look at him .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Whether he was for or against is anybody 's guess .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But later he would kill him .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But Vaughn was indeed the upstanding , hardworking , hands-on businessman that he appeared to be .
va	S_VP_.	Thinking about one 's self can 't do it , because self-centered thoughts are weak when compared to the call of eternity .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Once again Victoria found herself trailing after him like a puppy .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Not if it hurts like this .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Whatever was being discussed was muted to me .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they mention that ?
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How long ago was that ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	A man who made me wish for things I can 't have .
va	S_CC_S_.	When he did return , he clapped me on the shoulder and I could see the tension finally draining from him .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Too bad it wasn 't going to be that simple .
va	S_CC_S_.	He then took her hand and led her to the pallet on the floor and they disappeared beneath the covers .
va	S_NP_VP_.	After a few moments , Jake reappeared and one by one the survivors climbed out of the tunnel and got their first look at the destruction .
va	VP_.	Wait for this bastard to make his move .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I just hear him correctly ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	All the warning she needed to keep this vampire firmly at arm 's length .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How does it work , lighting a candle for someone ?
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What had she been forced to endure ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now all I have to do is wait .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When we are faced with difficult decisions our focus takes on a narrow view .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the doctor guided the other end to the right spot .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When none came he continued speaking .
va	S_VP_.	Removing them would improve the smell in the room greatly .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When husbands treat their wives gently then these same men become more civilized .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So they knew the yacht identity even if the Russians didn 't .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were men so easily swayed by a beautiful face ?
va	SBAR_VP_.	What Josie 's dad had said was right .
va	SBAR_VP_.	That I couldn 't express that had nothing to do with her and everything to do with me .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why do we have to involve so many people ?
va	VP_.	Had to be his .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I reach down my throat and pull out a black widow wedged in it .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she was gone .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	That I wasn 't smart enough to have one .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Chapter Three How can it be that he 's here ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe the crone would tell us something that changed what I believed and proved that Zayne was right .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Once we had a prisoner returned to us by the tribesmen as a warning .
va	S_NP_VP_.	She felt a little stiff but finally rested from all the nightmares she had .
va	NP_PP_.	"One of the "" bad experiments "" that should never have seen the light of day ."
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And still she hesitated .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	The hell I was .
va	NP_PP_.	Any excuse for a touch .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just keep pounding her face with my fists , letting the fury take control of me .
va	OTHER	And that he loved horses was just an added bonus .
va	S_CC_S_.	My fight or flight mode kicked in and everything pointed to flight .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so it wasn 't .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I expecting to wow him with witty dialogue ?
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they were taken from me for no reason at all .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I thought about it .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before he could argue I rushed into the girl 's bathroom , leaned against one of the stalls and clutched at my heart .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then all pandemonium broke loose .
va	NP_PP_.	""" Home with Alexis ."
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Next you 'll be quoting Scripture .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	None of the things I 've so often seen in people 's eyes when I 've had to tell them my story .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps her luck was returning .
va	OTHER	Almost as if something worse was coming tomorrow .
va	VP_.	To be with me .
va	SBAR_VP_.	When as a little boy he 'd looked at such a figure and felt the deep consummate recognition that it meant unconditional love .
va	VP_.	"Zoey : "" Why should I ?"
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did his ancestors feel the same kind of fear he did as they trudged over the prairie alone ?
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he explained to them about the evil god twins , and for that I was eternally grateful .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Anyway you will be able to judge his progress when you return .
va	S_CC_S_.	The guilt swept through her and she felt like her heart would crack right open .
va	S_NP_VP_.	Something in the way she looked at him , something in the way she reacted to his affection .
va	OTHER	Or was it just attraction ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Slots # 71 to # 80 were assigned to the Alone Project .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I waited and drank too much coffee , which only got me more worked up .
va	S_VP_.	' Don 't tense , ' said Horowitz gently .
va	S_NP_VP_.	I matched the grin , not fighting the better mood that was quickly taking the place of the rotten one I 'd woke up in .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Travis just stood there .
va	SBAR_VP_.	How he 'd worked his way through two years of college , but was forced to give up his education when he couldn 't afford to continue .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why don 't you come with me for a little while this afternoon ?
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he growled something beneath his breath .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where would I go or do ?
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Because now it 's your idea ?
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he drew away and pulled a glow stick from his pocket .
va	VP_.	Used her to get here ?
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I lean against the cellar wall , retracing the events of the last day .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I want to spend my life in greater isolation than I already did as an outcast goth ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Kali really didn 't know him .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Because it hadn 't seemed bad enough .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I doused my candle and made my way back to your room in the dark .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Because Chase had asked Rick to put a lid on Sloane 's identity .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He softly traced the line of my cheekbone and his fingers swept my chestnut curls over one shoulder .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe she did and just didn 't care .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Even walking as careful as he could he could still feel water soaking through his shoes and pants .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I really need to go to London .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were they aware he was mentally unstable ?
va	S_CC_S_.	Luke left and Claire set my leg , then , she too , left me to sleep .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did that mean that her struggle for power in Andor was going well ?
va	NP_PP_.	No motion from within .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What does it mean ?
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And it 's slightly bigger than Michael Dowell or my math test .
va	S_CC_S_.	He turned around and there he was , just arriving at the bar .
va	NP_VP_.	she asked with a smirk on her face .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then she was used to weirdness .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	How many times do we have to have this discussion ?
va	NP_VP_.	Dylan hurried after him .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he actually remember them ?
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Why she thought of Clay as the underdog she had no idea .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Again he prayed his countermeasures held .
va	S_CC_S_.	Dawn was quickly approaching and her absence would soon be noticed .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the money matter that much to him ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He just had to figure out how to proceed .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	She herself understood the comfort of a warm male beside you , sharing your bed , picturing poor Farid .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	After a thoughtful break in his words he made a proposal .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But he hadn 't just cut skin .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So my instincts hadn 't been wrong .
va	NP_PP_.	The desperation of needing to be believed .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	The last time I 'd seen Jamey he was doing everything he could to get back together .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he tracked them through the steep streets , in and out of one dancing place after another where the electronic music blared .
va	S_VP_.	Asking permission to hit my newbie was odd , though .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So Vincent stared down at his hands .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Before leaving the aircraft you will be issued a clean set of clothes and a new pack that may come in handy for the following challenges .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	This evening he walked the entire length of the ward unaided .
va	S_NP_VP_.	He turned to look at the ones he 'd saved .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The door jerks open an inch every few seconds as whoever is on the other side continuously bangs against it .
va	NP_PP_.	A lot of explaining .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you finally give in to your longing to have what Derek Novak had ?
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So he 'd taken Brooke to Brittany 's restaurant / lounge for supper one night .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did we have to move here anyway ?
va	VP_.	Exploring each other to see if they fit in other ways than in bed .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The rover finally tipped .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I bury my face in his neck like I wanted to the first time I met him .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	For the most part it is wise for Shadowhunters to avoid Faerie .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But three days and Alex 's tracking device inactive ... Every inch of Hatch 's raw stomach burned after ten years of worrying about his pseudo offspring .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he was someone I had a class with and didn 't remember .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it appeared to be a lady ruler .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How far down does this place go ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Evidently money was as unimportant to Preston as she 'd suspected .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he carefully pulled them out and lifted them to her lips , brushing lightly over her mouth with the dew of champagne .
va	S_VP_.	Hearing this from his point of view is so heartbreaking .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And once again there fell upon Ransom the feeling that it was not she , or not she only , who had spoken .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	That night a car was sent to get Jesse 's clothing and whatever she might want from the Chelsea flat .
va	S_VP_.	Giving them a bit of defense against any infected who may try to approach the city .
va	S_VP_.	Just looking at it gave me a bad feeling .
va	NP_VP_.	"That didn 't sound too bad ... "" How very noble of you ."
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he was one of these super responsible kids who could never let loose .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	That they were still a team , working together to save her land and his mother .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course he wanted out of the house .
va	S_CC_S_.	Oriole took a deep breath to calm herself , while Fred snapped his notebook closed and both headed to the SUV .
va	NP_VP_.	I hope you will all stay for a while and rest before returning to your homes .
va	OTHER	Is it an emergency ?
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So she had to do something now .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why in the bloody hell did Americans insist on cold beer ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	Lifting the cup to her lips she took a sip smiling .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Why hadn 't she believed Jimmy ?
va	VP_.	Set it for seventy-five yards .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What they were actually doing was a more civilized form of what was going on in the world at large .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he turned to Summer .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	For him to show her his world and everything he 'd ever known before he 'd met her .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	How many shots did that make ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	Kylie recalled Derek telling her he 'd dated a vampire named Ellie .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Meanwhile we carry on with only one plan and one train of thought .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's not to hate about a chick like that ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	""" Prove it , Blood Bag , "" Jester said ."
va	S_CC_S_.	Pulling a weapon from behind his back , he bashes his own head and in seconds only a pile of sand remains where he once stood .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	At the house the master 's chair was empty .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I had something worse than a black reaper gunning for me .
va	NP_PP_.	""" Good luck in here ."
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If she could only get her hands on him she 'd show him who he was dealing with .
va	NP_PP_.	""" A friend of mine ."
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But the soft lazy ambience of New Orleans clung to her .
va	OTHER	Then walked over and stabbed controls in front of stunned officers .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Eventually I had to , before it got weird .
va	NP_VP_.	The tall one frowned .
va	NP_PP_.	Same with that table .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And next I knew we were going into the synagogue .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she explain to Tosh her mixed up reactions to him and Jason when she didn 't understand them herself ?
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	After he was dressed she 'd fasten his points , the strings which tied his breeches and doublet together .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But the eagerness and zeal I possessed earlier had gone , and gone far .
va	OTHER	Just like the rest of him .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What did he care if Clara 's mom was kicked out or not ?
va	S_VP_.	To just glance at a set of normal teeth seemed like a dream .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he would try this and see .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do you develop such deep feelings for someone so fast ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Hopefully I can pass some of that knowledge along to you .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	When was the last time he 'd enjoyed a lovely , young woman 's company ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	I slammed the door and walked down the stairs to our gym , thankful it was empty .
va	NP_PP_.	The Union of American States .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I Oh wow look progress .
va	OTHER	He seems to falter but then he shakes his head resolutely .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What do you think is going on ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just prayed that if he was coming after me , he would show up soon .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But strength isn 't everything .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So he decided to end this now .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So you made a mistake .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then blue flames licked along his arm and travelled up his body .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	Who else could it be ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sure enough it was T-Bone .
va	NP_VP_.	He spun a glamour around himself to obscure his tell-tale features .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why get on the unsociable side of someone with three times your killing power ?
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it wrong to be so bloody fucking turned on when my wife dominated me ?
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he yawned .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But she wasn 't going to bother Meredith about it at a time like this .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she scratching her itch , so to speak ?
va	NP_VP_.	I loved living in a city like Chi town .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But he didn 't have a clue how that was going to happen while she protected a deserter brother .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I skipped eighth period and walked to Kristin 's house .
va	NP_PP_.	A lot of swell news .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe the darkness could make them , too , feel more alive than ever .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Though they weren 't that far away neither noticed her .
va	NP_VP_.	Her body was curvy enough to make a man dizzy .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Because no one has ever talked about what it 's really like in the arena before .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then the chameleon strikes .
va	S_NP_VP_.	I knew the minute I had left this morning she was on the phone to Ryan .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Abraham expect You to stop him ?
va	S_CC_S_.	The little lines that webbed their way out from his eyes were more pronounced than normal and his expression was slightly slack .
va	OTHER	Do they ever mention cows ?
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What kind of a woman -- or any person , for that matter -- spent their time memorizing any book , let alone Frankenstein ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	Lorelai flutters around like a butterfly , proudly showing off her summer dress to the cat she named Kit Cat .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	This time I asked for a large glass of milk to go with it .
va	VP_.	Avoid it for I know it will only bring pain .
va	NP_VP_.	They seemed young , all of them , still young enough to be called girls .
va	NP_VP_.	He wants to be part of the creating process .
va	S_CC_S_.	I take a bite of my sandwich and it tastes delicious , as always .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She practically stumbled over from surprise , her heart threatening to a stop right in her chest .
va	S_CC_S_.	The jet bridge attached to the plane and she filed out , grabbing her carry-on luggage , which hadn 't fit overhead on the small regional plane .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What did she think , some creature was going to lunge out of the toilet bowl and attack her ?
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So this is what being crazy feels like .
va	S_NP_VP_.	She would also set several men to repairing or rebuilding pens for the animals her husband was bringing back , while she herself worked on the gardens .
va	NP_VP_.	I could crush her before she even had a chance to yell for help .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Before he could answer Hunter felt a tap on his shoulder .
va	S_VP_.	To have been carried down to meet with bluffs would have been fatal .
va	S_CC_S_.	It was ten days ago when the plane crashed into the facility and the dingoes escaped .
va	OTHER	And who do you keep talking about ?
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was Lisa laughing at cartoons as much as she used to ?
va	S_CC_S_.	Miles studied her face and she still refused to meet his eyes .
va	OTHER	So what if I had to work a few more nights this month ?
va	PP_NP_VP_.	With that she took a deep breath , closed her eyes for a brief moment , and then opened them .
va	OTHER	Not even a good bye .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What he cannot know is the British high command never sees this second battle as a defeat .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We just talked about what happened , Gavin and I , while Charles typed it all into his computer for the records .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What had he been thinking of ?
va	VP_.	Let it pulsate through his veins .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	In her mind images flashed of them together .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least Seth would be slowed by his currently busted ankle .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why is it you always get the beautiful fun ones ?
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then she thought about Mona and the others hanging out in the driveway , Emily lurking near the mailbox .
va	S_CC_S_.	My grip on the tablet tightens and I grit my teeth .
va	S_VP_.	Holding her ground wasn 't working .
va	NP_PP_.	""" Coming from your mother ?"
va	NP_PP_.	The state of Media .
va	S_VP_.	Taking him deep , then stirring until the crown brushed that sensitive spot inside over and over .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So he felt it , too .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Tomorrow he would be back from his two weeks out to sea .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	How right at this very moment she was thinking thoughts that brought a hint of color to her face .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now she was facing a different issue of survival , based on the one commodity Quin apparently had in plenty .
va	S_CC_S_.	Once the doctors had finished the operation , Eloise was stitched up and her vital signs checked before she was wheeled into a recovery room .
va	S_NP_VP_.	I watched her lips wrap around the edge of the wine glass with each sip she took as they left an imprint of her lipstick .
va	S_CC_S_.	I dial his number and he answers the phone on the third ring .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And it would be up to me to do it .
va	OTHER	Would you have the seed you have planted take root in the heart of another boy ?
va	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knew how hard it was to stay quiet ?
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And I didn 't blame her .
va	S_VP_.	Cleaning the house from top to bottom and from one end to the other would probably keep us both out of mischief for quite some time .
va	S_VP_.	Pulling up to Ryan Hendricks 's house felt like deja vu .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So many lies had already been told .
va	S_CC_S_.	I curled my bare toes as we stepped onto the grass and I realized it wasn 't real grass but Astroturf .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Dark it will be , with soft boughs for a bed .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least a hundred werewolves are dead , including Praetor Scott and Jordan Kyle .
va	VP_.	Let me do that .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where 's my cane ?
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What did just happen ?
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So the game goes on , tentatively at first , then building in volume and vulgarity as they lose their suspicion and forget her presence altogether .
va	OTHER	For once I 'm not doing something for my own convenience .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What would they say to her ?
va	OTHER	But I the dignified narrator am too aloof to answer such questions .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Once again his vengeance must be held .
va	NP_VP_.	The end of the wire was only twisted around a tie down loop on the bulkhead just inside the door .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	After what I 've done for you !
va	IN_NP_VP_.	For they were merely there to learn the ways of the dark arts , and then pass them on to the forthcoming members who would join .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What she didn 't say was that she would 've welcomed the opportunity to know Vaughn Kyle better .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Apparently Mary Elise didn 't take hints .
va	S_NP_VP_.	A helmet automatically makes its way from behind me and covers my head spontaneously the visor tints itself to adjust my eyes to the sweltering hot weather .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he saw shoes and then something even more disturbing .
va	S_CC_S_.	I could read him and he could read me .
va	NP_VP_.	Monty asked as he came up beside me .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Later that day the friends decided to head up towards town .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What does it matter to you ?
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then my boyfriend drove down from San Francisco to surprise me .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	People you 've spoken too .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	A son he could only have if he took a second wife .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why else would they let this happen to me ?
va	S_CC_S_.	The whole thing was embarrassing then and it 's just as embarrassing for me now .
va	SBAR_VP_.	How about we go get some breakfast .
va	VP_.	See if I care .
va	NP_VP_.	The advantage that we had was that I was with my men .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So they make them suffer .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	For his will remained and guided his servants , moving them ever to thwart the will of the Valar and to destroy those that obeyed them .
va	NP_PP_.	Now for the antenna .
va	OTHER	Open , non-judgmental , interested but a bit skeptical .
va	VP_.	Had this all been a test ?
va	OTHER	Could he really help it if his charcoal gray Charger demanded to be driven a little recklessly once in a while ?
va	VP_.	Couldn 't get out .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If it wasn 't for Todd he 'd probably be out of work and living at home .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he heard a child 's giggle .
va	S_NP_VP_.	To look more sincere Lusty Crow offered her and Woodpecker classes in local birds language .
va	S_NP_VP_.	I had a weird flashback to the time I 'd first inherited the Thorn Land , when my own villages had suffered from drought .
va	NP_PP_.	Seventeen years with her mother and over a decade working in domestic violence shelters .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What Keith had done was so grossly unfair .
va	NP_VP_.	His silence left her with nothing to do but stare out the window .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But he couldn 't be sure .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Bishop desperately grabbed at one of the fluttering leaves and managed to pluck it out of the air before it caught fire .
va	NP_PP_.	That despite everything , that even after we had fought so hard to be together , a few thousand miles would destroy it all .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He almost felt like shouting out loud as he started making his way around the same familiar Red Mountain area .
va	S_NP_VP_.	They gazed at each other , Catcher telling her things I couldn 't hear over the grate and rumble of the El .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why was he calling me that ?
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Since then he 'd never looked back , and often hadn 't looked down either .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So much of the technology we spend our time on is geared toward this .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What can any of them do ?
va	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knows what those hands did .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The water itself was thick with sludge , completely unlike the waterways leading to it .
va	S_NP_VP_.	She 'd told the gang that her time with him on Lord Howe Island had proved to her they had no future together .
va	NP_VP_.	He face was unreadable as he sat down and folded his hands .
va	S_NP_VP_.	We run to anywhere we can hide .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were these tears that were already entering the scene ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Occasionally they met others on foot who were walking in the direction of traffic .
va	S_VP_.	Being a Para didn 't make someone a monster .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Alexander have to hide my identity like I had to hide his ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	That I was , in fact , his killer .
va	OTHER	* * * Jace was off the couch and at the bottom of the stairs as soon as Deni stepped off them .
va	VP_.	Name the time and day !
va	OTHER	Not by a long shot .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they could hear the legs of a spider crawling over the moldy ceiling .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	In the end I wanted to live .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What do you think ?
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I absently stroked it until Noah halted my motion by placing his hand firmly on top of mine .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I cast the charm and used some wolves to protect my livestock from the others .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	What a different drive this was for her now .
va	NP_VP_.	He was drinking in her entire body with his eyes , every dimple , every inch of her skin .
va	OTHER	Can you believe it ?
va	NP_PP_.	Every night for a week .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So many plastic bags filled with food of all kinds lay on the wooden shelves , hidden behind the wooden barrier .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What did I do wrong ?
va	VP_.	looking at it from another person 's perspective .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But he had seen it .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I 'll tell you what .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then she said , "" They won 't talk to me about my mum 's condition ."
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What does she know about something like this ?
va	WHNP_SQ_.	Wonder what crisis is boiling up now ?
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she raced back to bed with a squeal .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But apparently Ann Yanni 's celebrity status overcame her reluctance .
va	S_VP_.	Judging by that sound , whatever demon may have been present didn 't have a solid grip on the hearts and spirits of these young men .
va	S_NP_VP_.	Matching and finding him love would be her greatest satisfaction .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	For the king was to ride forth as soon as the men of the town and those dwelling near could be armed and assembled .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Not since the birth of Judy had he felt so unsure of what to do .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What must Chuck think of her strange behavior ?
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So that 's what we did .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why can 't the priests in our palace be this helpful ?
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So he sat in the emptiness for a time , until at last you and your company came across him .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What did her hair have to do with anything ?
va	VP_.	Had to have him buried deep inside her .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then someone took her elbow .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So that was why he was keeping his distance .
va	NP_VP_.	I can still hear her saying it .
va	VP_.	Don 't come to me at all if you don 't want any part of fatherhood because the baby and I. . .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then Herod 's men had killed Zechariah !
va	NP_NP_VP_.	One day he 'd rather forget , because if he doesn 't , the guilt will consume him .
va	VP_.	Be very careful where you store it too .
va	S_NP_VP_.	Here I was telling her I 'd be honest when I wasn 't entirely .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could any maiden resist such a potent charm ?
va	S_CC_S_.	The evening drew in and finally Angelina decided that it was time to head home .
va	NP_PP_.	One vague notion after another .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I saw a glint of light underneath the crib .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	His phone finally rang .
va	OTHER	Once we fell onto the bed , it took only minutes for us to both fall asleep , our bodies still entangled together .
va	NP_VP_.	I was so glad to see them that I almost didn 't notice Bella sitting on Ty 's lap in the corner .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And I 've never seen you look so tired .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then she said , "" Did Fat Charlie know about this ?"
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe I changed .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	* Sam kept to the ridge where he was able to keep Becky in sight all the time she 'd been making good her escape .
va	S_VP_.	Pressing the subject obviously wasn 't a good idea .
va	S_CC_S_.	Bay carefully pulled away the hospital blanket and together they tucked the baby into Melody 's patchwork one .
va	S_NP_VP_.	We 'll have thirty lengths between us by the time we make it to the outcropping .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	A few moments later she stumbled out of the doorway into the brisk , cold morning .
va	NP_VP_.	He put it up to his ear and started to speak as if he had someone on the other end .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	By the time they had reached agreement Lizzie had arrived .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	That afternoon they strolled the beach , taking in the disappearing rays of the sun before eating at one of the finer restaurants on the island .
va	S_NP_VP_.	She searched her mind for something she wouldn 't mind giving up .
va	S_CC_S_.	Feeling as if she had been slapped Aria went to pull away but he seized hold of her hand .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She still drove the same car she 'd owned when they dated .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because I knew you wouldn 't see it that way .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Because you have never done one single thing for me in the entire time since I became a vampire .
va	S_CC_S_.	He flies higher into the sky and I see a giant fireball coming towards me .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	On any given day she could be found behind the white Formica counter , dispensing drinks , advice and criticism in equal doses .
va	S_CC_S_.	She said that at first , it might seem like something was trying to invade his mind but to let his heart guide him .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As he wrestled with it he was aware for the first time that his hands were shaking ever so slightly .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So I pushed my way through the pressing crowd and to the bar .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What Steve found in those last few moments was what I thought he 'd lost for ever C his humanity .
va	S_VP_.	' Don 't worry about it , ' said Pip .
va	SBAR_VP_.	How smoothly he lied , how easily the words rolled off his tongue , but Phoebe wasn 't fooled .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he after ?
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And he was a nice guy , too .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And it wasn 't just small robots .
va	S_CC_S_.	I nod and we head out of the cave , leaving the dead vampire behind .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So men like that really do exist .
va	SBAR_VP_.	As if he could pop around for a coffee .
va	S_NP_VP_.	There was a car passing by and in a slow motion I saw a wave of snow coming towards me .
va	NP_PP_.	A particular adventure involving his parents and Bax popped into Matthew 's mind . .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	A stream of waiters carefully wheeled a tall chocolate cake with a single sparkler candle poking out the top to a nearby table .
va	SBAR_VP_.	Because it seemed like he 'd shot her .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Maybe if I could just get Ben out if the way for a bit I could come back ?
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have to picture herself floating to the top ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	He didn 't even have the balls to tell me he would be there .
va	SBAR_VP_.	If you want the truth to be known then all you need to do is tell the Witch Mother .
va	S_VP_.	""" Thank you "" stated Simon looking down at his hands ."
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was that even possible ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	One day Dillon was riding along the river bank when he heard yelling from the other side .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But that was impossible .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Whether it was lust for me or desire in securing his power I would never know .
va	S_VP_.	Gripping on to the wheel Allie pulled to the right .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	"After everything that happened , after everything ended the way it did , I - "" he breathed in and closed his eyes ."
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet they did , and even seemed to find enjoyment in it , when surely the only sensible course would be to despair .
va	OTHER	Years ago fellow players game him the nickname of the mannequin .
va	S_VP_.	Pounding on the front door had stopped him .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So much laborious counting .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So he wasn 't any of those things .
va	S_VP_.	Seeing Mrs. Haynes cry was almost unbearable .
va	OTHER	""" No need for restraints ."
va	S_NP_VP_.	I watched his long legs and the way his wide shoulders looked in that jacket .
va	NP_PP_.	A couple of birds who warble a mean tune .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	One summer they even let Matt go to space camp because he insisted he wanted to be an astronaut .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	With that conclusion I released my focus on Brent .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He quickly flipped it .
va	S_CC_S_.	Dad was in the room with him and he accidentally fell asleep .
va	S_CC_S_.	His desk was empty and there were no files anywhere .
va	S_CC_S_.	He limped and I thought for some reason , this to be a result of the process that had brought him here .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But I need to do this alone .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What had he done to offend the Empress ?
va	NP_VP_.	I waved my finger up and down , mimicking her motions .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did anyone think to check her home there ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	One lucky night I got there just as the kids were getting ready for bed .
va	VP_.	Sucking out your magic .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why didn 't you tell me you had a history with her ?
va	VP_.	Listening to me crying , laughing , raging , sighing over it .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then they both fell silent as the door to the bedchamber opened .
va	VP_.	Tell me I 'm all you ever wanted .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Lately he 'd been hooking up with Gloria Rubin , a waitress at a bar he frequented when he didn 't go to Night Owl 's .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	And I love you too .
va	S_NP_VP_.	Decided it was a bad idea .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Nine miles an hour , then ten , then eleven .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she be ?
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now her face would be broadcast statewide by lunchtime , which was only a few minutes away .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But his mother was the blacksmith 's daughter .
va	S_CC_S_.	I gaped in disbelief at his answer and he chuckled at the look on my face .
va	NP_VP_.	I glanced up his torso and jumped .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he led his four followers through one of the checkout lanes .
va	VP_.	Wasn 't just a threat .
va	NP_PP_.	The world of battles and death .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	On their way home they were just trying to forget they ever ran into him .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once he knew she was asleep he would be able to break in through a window and then get closer than he 'd ever been before .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But my anxiety had nothing to do with him now .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Chapter 30 Conner It was John .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she really dismissing him after their afternoon together ?
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are we playing this game ?
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What purpose could that possibly have served you ?
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But he wasn 't going anywhere until he found out what was wrong with her .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	This way I could put him out of my mind and focus on what was important .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When the line of children and their supporters finally turned into the railway marshalling area all hell broke loose .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What was Baxter feeling ?
va	IN_NP_VP_.	For it was their truth hidden as their lie .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	From them I learned that the weird pack had found several more human victims .
va	NP_VP_.	He started to shake violently .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But before they would board a plane in the morning to travel to Italy for their honeymoon .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	In a way it 's too bad you aren 't aware of the real threat in her life .
va	CC_NP_VP_.	But she knew they couldn 't go on like this for much longer , using only the language of their bodies .
va	NP_VP_.	He raised another blade and handed it to her .
va	S_CC_S_.	Anne 's chin was stronger and more square-shaped and her mouth was wider with fuller lips .
va	NP_PP_.	A four on the Jones Scale .
va	S_NP_VP_.	Grasping the top he felt a vibration on the ladders below .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Not what I 'd expected from Dr. Kells .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What choice did I have ?
va	PP_NP_VP_.	At this point I didn 't care which way I was going , just as long as it was away from danger .
va	VP_.	Wake up and stay quiet .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Saturday night was over , and so was her overreaction to Colin 's defection .
va	NP_VP_.	Alec pushed up his sunglasses , noting that the heckler was one of a group of three people walking by .
va	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then her face is beautiful once again , flawless .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So much emotion filled his eyes that her breath caught .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Cove burn more than one town three years ago ?
va	WHNP_SQ_.	How many times can those guys debate who has better fries : Sonic or Jiffy Burger ?
va	NP_NP_VP_.	Every kind of shrimp you can imagine .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So much for going to Lexy 's .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you are medically sure he is dead .
va	S_NP_VP_.	The only hitch is , the things that get enhanced in your head aren 't always the things you were good at as a human .
va	S_VP_.	Accomplishing exactly what he 'd achieved was her ultimate goal for the future .
va	IN_NP_VP_.	So they have to flare it off .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What the god didn 't know was that Arik wouldn 't forget .
va	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course he didn 't have a key .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	we all shouted and started running across the battlefield .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What say we grab some dinner ?
va	S_VP_.	Having made the decision to change I felt a sense of relaxation .
va	SBAR_VP_.	What he said and what he did weren 't always the same .
va	S_VP_.	Looking back was too painful for her .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he thumped Jake on the back .
va	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he rises to his feet .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now it was her mother who laughed .
va	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We all have free will , Sam .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What did it mean ?
va	OTHER	Never make you feel small and worthless .
va	NP_VP_.	I asked , bewildered .
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	A couple hours later we were pulling up at the magnificent ranch .
va	WHADVP_SQ_.	When did Richard and Andrea get to know each other , anyway ?
va	ADVP_NP_VP_.	then she might be able to do the same for the rest of the court .
va	WHNP_SQ_.	What was he doing here ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	Giving the house a top-to-bottom cleaning , and throwing out the old stuff she wouldn 't want in her new home .
va	NP_NP_VP_.	This time I was the one waiting for him .
va	VP_.	Fought death to save his brother 's life .
va	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did your daddy know what you intended to do with the money ?
va	S_NP_VP_.	He moved between her legs , so shockingly , deeply intimate , and bent her back over the counter .
va	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she arrived at the library she realized how much she didn 't want to run into James or Jennifer .
te	S_VP_.	Just hearing his voice made her want him as much as she ever had .
te	NP_VP_.	The voice that roared over the long-distance wires threatened to impair Maryanne 's hearing .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he pointed at Merri Lee .
te	S_CC_S_.	I didn 't want to have him think of me differently but I couldn 't lie to him about the scars he 'd already seen .
te	OTHER	A month later the year 1900 brought the century to a close and a new era was in the air .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Only you can decide what happens now .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She quickly fumbled through them , and opened the door .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he know who I was ?
te	S_CC_S_.	He lifts his head up and his eyes are blue again .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Until that moment he had thought himself Lucian 's equal .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where 's the next meet up ?
te	NP_NP_VP_.	The next day I accidently overslept .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That we 'll end up at the same party .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was the fact of the matter that he was killed for being implicated in his sister 's witchcraft ?
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I saw a flash .
te	NP_VP_.	The two-man ambulance crew moved their patient inside as if a doctor inside might throw out the orders and go to work on the man .
te	S_VP_.	Finding us is like a needle in a haystack in the mountains even if the Army knows we 're missing .
te	OTHER	Now let 's get the food ready for tonight !
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So much doubt about humanity 's future filled her heart .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then Flynn draws it back to behind his head before swinging his arm forward and releasing the knife .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	The next morning I woke up and went out to breakfast knowing that the smell of food would make Amber sick .
te	S_VP_.	Staying as far away from Nate sounded like a great plan in my book .
te	NP_PP_.	No grand schemes of controlling the world .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When they had led her away she had gone without a fight , looking back to see them drag Angelina away .
te	S_CC_S_.	Gus smiled and his smile broadened to a grin .
te	NP_VP_.	It was only a matter of time before I went looking for you .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	With each step she prayed that in the deepest , darkest part of the graveyard under the trees , she 'd find her grandfather .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So I drew in a breath , pushed up my sleeves , and wrapped my bare hands around the notebook .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	At the moment he didn 't know if he wanted to force her to leave , or taste her more .
te	NP_VP_.	Fin 's eyes pinched together .
te	NP_PP_.	Other than that it was a peaceful night .
te	S_VP_.	Bearing the title would be akin to wearing a mask .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What will my parents do with the reception , the honeymoon , and all of the disappointed guests ?
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That I was ready .
te	NP_PP_.	""" Diana Malone , obsessed since her husband 's untimely death with finding evidence of a paranormal creature and clearing his name ."
te	VP_.	Then again in the shower .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would you need it if you dig all the wisdom out of your own mind ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	He walked up the driveway and around to the side of Josh 's house and through the window he saw Melly at the stove .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	"If I start siding with the humans ... "" my voice trailed off , refusing to think of the implications ."
te	NP_VP_.	I made a fist with my hands and pounded it against his chest , hard , my tears flowing .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So I started on pills again .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he have an angle ?
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Then how could I resist the conditioning ?
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Their ships just hover overhead .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I heard screeching tires as they made their escape .
te	S_NP_VP_.	He glanced at his computer , waiting for that little window to come up to tell him he had a new email .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And it wasn 't the first time Walter Blake done the Johnsons over .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he 'd roam again and come back to her .
te	S_CC_S_.	I eyed it with disdain but he didn 't remove it .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If I had to pay three hundred a year for my house I could not keep a table .
te	S_NP_VP_.	I don 't bother telling him it 's all I have , since it 's none of his business .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What is the most precious for you in this world ?
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why in the hell is this happening ?
te	VP_.	Beneath him , in bed .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So flying , to me , means an adventure is beginning .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe he 's shy .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where would you want to work ?
te	PP_NP_VP_.	After a quick shower she changed into a comfortable jean skirt and top and started the task of packing .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she want me to do anything else ?
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And we ´ ve got another shot at showing the universe that we are not just animals .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Very suddenly the lights went out .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now the older man peered over the top of his spectacles at the view .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he batted his Beta away .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you want to survive you need to take this training course .
te	VP_.	Says Greg after about fifteen minutes .
te	S_VP_.	Falling in love with Elizabeth may have been part of it .
te	OTHER	She wanted ice cream for dessert and then when she got ice cream , she wanted cake .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What sort of person would I be if I were to meet up with him and dump him after his mother had died ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	For the Pool truly was a sacred place , and only anything pure had ever witnessed it and been allowed to live .
te	S_NP_VP_.	She 'd have free rein to be with whomever she wanted to be .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I always chalked Lea 's animosity toward me as a product of her general bitchiness , when in reality I had been nothing more than a bully .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So he 'd made Rutger roll his round body out of bed and wink him here to the Fifth Reality .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was there ever so unexpected an assertion of superiority ?
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes Will could not help remembering Thomas as he had first come to the Institute .
te	S_CC_S_.	Kaylin went with them and the ladies seemed excited about helping her .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What was his name again ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	Who 's coming is Annie 's job .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Might as well go for broke since he sure could use some advice .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Good thing he 'd locked the door .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then another came around the corner .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So I could understand him wanting to forget , to move on .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I 'm finished I walk into the kitchen to grab a bottle of water and see that there is a note on the counter .
te	NP_VP_.	They weren 't a chant but a plea .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I immediately stand and walk to him , placing my hands on his shoulders , fearing that he 's about to explode .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I was small we would hop on and off the Petersburg express .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When she looked in on John he was awake .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did it have to do with my imaginings ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	Ragnar crouched down next to him and pulled a pair of spectacles out of the box he held .
te	VP_.	Screw the whole telling him part .
te	S_NP_VP_.	"The air conditioner is turned up as high as it will go and "" Shake it Out "" by Florence + The Machine plays from the speakers ."
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What could he buy for people who had everything they needed and more money than they could spend in a lifetime ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	What felt like hot iron band wrapped around my neck as the pain increased and increased until I couldn 't hold in my screams any longer .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just know they 're here .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do people afford a house like this ?
te	VP_.	Purple and floral and filled with pictures of Kim .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	A new toy he 'd just been given .
te	NP_VP_.	The worst part was that I 'd never even really known I 'd cared .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	For years I 've been subjecting myself to the rays of the sun .
te	S_NP_VP_.	I ran up to her and scooped her in my arms , hugging her so tightly I may have bruised her ribs .
te	VP_.	yelled the massive human , his knee on Dean 's sternum .
te	S_VP_.	Standing back and accepting another one was something he simply could not do .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	Who else could have mouthed the location of the village ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet that first day was exactly how every other day of our marriage went .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Eventually we make it to the front door where I fumble with the keys .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How is he different from any other blind child ?
te	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course they didn 't .
te	VP_.	To have the baby on her own ?
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	First it was music praising himself as the Saviour of the world , the Prince of Princes , and the Lord of Creation .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	At the end of year 3 a full UN review of each country will be undertaken in readiness for the next Forum .
te	S_VP_.	Bending over and staring down at me was a paramedic .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	That realization almost sent him over the edge .
te	OTHER	Was she just an easy target for him ?
te	WHNP_SQ_.	How many years ago had he given it to her ?
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What explanation I can provide ?
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If they catch me here they will know I lied .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then there was no time to talk , to think , or even breathe .
te	NP_VP_.	Peggy could hear the rain pounding against the bay windows in the breakfast nook .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the brigands came around the curve in a cluster .
te	S_VP_.	Working his knee back into shape would be a slow process .
te	NP_PP_.	The man of my nightmare .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	The other day I attended a pretty special celebration , a graduation .
te	S_CC_S_.	Her voice was wistful and I understood her reluctance .
te	S_NP_VP_.	I never thought I 'd care about anyone again the way I care about you .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	Like a wet noodle I could sever with the lightest of twitches .
te	OTHER	Does this look like class to you , Celeste ?
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So much blood , and yet it didn 't appeal to me .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As Abby made a sandwich she wondered who Jess would introduce her to , and whether she had a nice brother or knew any cute guys .
te	NP_VP_.	Kramer muttered to himself .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even her pale icy blue eyes were twinkling .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But not before I see the smile of pure pleasure pulling at her lips .
te	NP_VP_.	I 'd be a fool to deny she meant something to me .
te	SBAR_VP_.	Because the more we risk our necks , the stronger we 're letting our enemies get .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she have any idea how desirable she looked right at the moment ?
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	When would she get to talk to Mike and find out what ghosts were haunting him ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	He scrambled back to his feet , looked again into the mirror , studied the hair and face and body of someone he 'd never seen before .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Things I wanted to happen .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	In the morning there was a double excitement for her .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So it was his room or the attic room .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it 's that I don 't want him to want to go .
te	SBAR_VP_.	As we round the corner outside the building Mom puts an arm around me .
te	S_CC_S_.	It sent shivers down my spine and I froze , couldn 't move or talk .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she waited for him in his bed .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did it hurt to see Torin with someone else ?
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But she loved him for making the attempt .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't she have invented a persona that allowed her to wear dresses like that ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	What she remembered wasn 't a dream .
te	NP_PP_.	"Their wild cries of "" Odin !"
te	NP_VP_.	My heart danced in my chest .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What would I ask him ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now he 's making a move .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Soon he spotted his destination , the Chesapeake Hotel .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What he did mind was anyone knowing the intensity of that desire .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Yesterday they had been blue .
te	S_NP_VP_.	One glance over her shoulder told Cheyenne that the Amos boys hadn 't taken her unexpected appearance in stride the way Presley had said they would .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Whatever we did back there will never be traced back to us .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And she 's funny .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are you looking moody ?
te	VP_.	""" One ... two ... three ... "" She hadn 't noticed before how your feet anchored you for sit-ups ."
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And that was all .
te	S_NP_VP_.	She wanted to be around her and a man she loved , and wanted him right away .
te	NP_VP_.	Tarquin 's eyes widened with glee .
te	VP_.	Tell me you haven 't changed your mind .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then I realized what he meant .
te	VP_.	Brought to an end .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But they appreciate my skills .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	For three years they had endured poverty in a two-room student apartment on a campus covered with Porsches and little Mercedes convertibles .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just as he could now see so many things she had wanted to keep from him .
te	S_NP_VP_.	"Miss Evans has been nominated for the coveted Peabody Award ... ' "" The story went on from there ."
te	NP_VP_.	His eyes were on her .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So many questions , not enough time to answer them .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had she thought he 'd felt like an outsider last week at her parents ' house ?
te	OTHER	Or that we had murdered our own in this dispute ?
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And they quickly disconnected .
te	NP_PP_.	""" A word of warning , my dear ."
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What would he do now ?
te	PP_NP_VP_.	For now it was quiet with only a few soldiers out in the streets .
te	S_CC_S_.	' No , I 'm just very experienced , ' Chicky had said and the decision had been made .
te	VP_.	More specifically , with my part of the world .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	At first the guard seemed indifferent to their entrance .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Probably she didn 't know what to say either .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What Stephen found was his wife squatting on the ground , rocking and bawling while the three year old child stood silently in a dark corner .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Just like they 'd done for New Year 's Eve they kept it simple , ignoring all suggestions for a grand affair .
te	VP_.	said Mary Ann , knowing whom he meant .
te	NP_VP_.	Go have some fun , Simon .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Then the men with guns had jumped from that van .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe she would irritate him more often .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So she cut to what mattered at this particular moment .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	Across from her sat the Joint Congressional Committee .
te	NP_PP_.	The year of genocide .
te	NP_VP_.	She couldn 't take the waiting anymore .
te	SBAR_VP_.	When one of the TED units expires my boys collect them for recycling .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What followed was predictable .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	I mental y kicked myself as he stepped inside and closed the door .
te	S_VP_.	To think you had inadvertently killed your own mentor !
te	WHNP_SQ_.	Or was he going to do everything in his power to correct it ?
te	PP_NP_VP_.	In the firelight he is watching me .
te	S_VP_.	Freely sharing copyrighted materials isn 't cool .
te	S_CC_S_.	With the set of swipe cards in hand I 'm too excited and I become careless , making too much noise as I walk .
te	NP_PP_.	""" Nothing but human laboratories ."
te	SBAR_VP_.	What I did know was that I fought next to my men and he remained hidden like a coward .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So things began to change , slowly .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then someone somewhere clicked the cosmic ' Resume ' button .
te	S_VP_.	Keeping a mare calm as she delivers a foal .
te	NP_PP_.	At least for now .
te	SBAR_VP_.	With it came the blinding light that had preceded it , growing and growing , until all else was blotted out .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	On it was written a telephone number .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now the door won 't budge .
te	OTHER	Could you drop it to me ?
te	S_VP_.	Holding a conversation with him had always been like talking to a person with the bricks half shy of a full load .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she really think he was that bad a person ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	When he bent his mouth to taste one tight nipple she swayed against him .
te	NP_VP_.	She glanced down at her clipboard .
te	S_VP_.	Wanted enough to get started .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he focused on me .
te	OTHER	Would you recite it for us ?
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	* * * A smartly dressed Johnny checked the address he 'd been given by the venue 's stage manager .
te	NP_VP_.	A psychotic male had fired several shots from his bedroom window at a group of unsuspecting Jehovah 's Witnesses after they rang his doorbell .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What they needed to know was where he was now .
te	NP_VP_.	The fight visibly slid out of Ward as he sagged into the seat .
te	OTHER	Just continues to stare at me , an unfathomable expression on his face .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Right at that moment it didn 't matter to him .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could an individual be ordered to have to go into some private clinic like this ?
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How is a Titan truly any worse than an Olympian running amok ?
te	VP_.	Glad to do that .
te	VP_.	Thank you for your support .
te	SBAR_VP_.	That he might not be a young man at all , but a very old soul , was in question .
te	NP_VP_.	The trunk flew off .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That she was going back to fix things because he wouldn 't ?
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He finally looked at her , seeing every ounce of weariness outnumbered by two of determination .
te	S_CC_S_.	She is also lovely and I am a healthy man .
te	OTHER	A man who believed in love .
te	S_CC_S_.	Ryder 's voice was cool but the look on his face was anything but .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had he come so close to the truth ?
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What do you think ?
te	OTHER	After all , it is plastic , I think .
te	OTHER	It had taken barely half a dozen half beats and two men now lay dead , whilst the fort around us slept on : silent and dark .
te	S_CC_S_.	One man handed the priest chalk and he proceeded to draw a triangle on the floor .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sometimes it was too mind-boggling for me to keep everything in my mind .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she shut the iron door and traced a few more marks over the threshold that glowed and then faded .
te	OTHER	And no real conviction .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I can tell that there definitely isn 't enough paper in the box for all of our names .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I supposed to touch Mason ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	What was about to take place was foremost in her thoughts and had her wondering if they 'd both lost their minds .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But too much water had run under that particular bridge .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So he came back from soccer camp acting like he was the man .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she think such a thing ?
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So he 'd eliminated Reed , just as he had the others .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	Who will accept the acceptance ?
te	NP_PP_.	Both sides of my family .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Before she knew what she was doing she lunged , knocked him across the room and grabbed the cup .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It kinda suits him well .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he was waving a white flag .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And every God damn time I give him the same response .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	""" Tuesday , early Tuesday morning ."
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But Rachel did want to understand what Dan 's perspective was .
te	NP_PP_.	West of Fort Worth .
te	OTHER	And was it possible that Balthazar More had showed up to rescue her ?
te	OTHER	The anger never completely left his eyes .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What she really wanted to do was sling the black guitar strap over her shoulder and walk away , never looking back .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Although we don 't have much time we 'll coordinate with the West Yorkshire police and take down Avi 's entire group plus the illegals .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I really wish I could find the top to the black one because I don 't need the jokes all day about the color red .
te	OTHER	Listening to his inner dialogue was like having an angel on one shoulder , a devil on the other .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And the beautiful redhead holding hands with him was not his wife .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she have given her heart to a man who 'd ravaged her self-respect ?
te	S_CC_S_.	This new information , however , Aedan didn 't have and Nathan was forced to report it to the Head of the Council .
te	VP_.	Spend the day with your parents , maybe see your friends .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Well , that and she launched paint over my head onto the wall she was working on .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What had that second flash of silver been ?
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And he named you as the conservator .
te	S_CC_S_.	Nash narrows his eyes on me and his lips curve up at the corners .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Her eyes slowly moved up the length of my body , to my face and then my hand .
te	S_VP_.	Identifying the owner would clear things up a little .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That I was back forced me to remember .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	I myself will go to war , to fall in the front of the battle , if it must be .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But I have to voice it .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What made it particularly urgent was that it came at the worst time , interfering with their plans to topple the other plutocrats .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he reached the door Diane moved out of his way .
te	OTHER	Maybe even his loyalty to an old friend he hadn 't seen in six years .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Cool air caressed her skin in a counterpoint to the heat Simon was creating .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Amen 2 January 2 , 1624 We spent our first Christmas and New Year together as a family .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But he hated school .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was that inappropriate for a boss to ask out an employee ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But first he had to call Rose and explain .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What did he mean ?
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she offended that he was suggesting she pay for the next date ?
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As they passed our table James smiled at us , then leaned in , and kissed her lips .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he finally looked back at her .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he lets me go .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I wouldn 't be so lucky .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	As far as I was concerned I was fairly average .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That night I dreamed about Sean .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know him ?
te	OTHER	In fact , he realized , it might draw him so far away from us that there would be no chance of our ever communicating with him .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she know him ?
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she stand by his bed and talk to him ... smile as if they 'd stayed friends ... and say good-bye ?
te	NP_PP_.	' Most of them .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why couldn 't he just go ?
te	VP_.	Positively beamed back at him .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe it was soaked in a water spa .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As Honey was leaving she smiled at Kell and held out her hand .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now the enemy was preparing to run off with the prize .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Let Us Prey is the first in her Gotcha Detective Agency Mysteries series .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really think of me that way ?
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And it was the moment I began to question if he was truly evil .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Always the military mind , more is always right but not this time .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he rose up and walked over to the grill to check on the chocolate .
te	SBAR_VP_.	Because she 'd now worked out how to bypass the security code and get into Jake 's safe .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he kneeled , reaching for the fallen cue stick .
te	SBAR_VP_.	Only after the sun had risen at least two hands above the horizon did a group of armed warriors enter the little hut and awaken the captives .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What made Francis turn out as he did ?
te	NP_NP_VP_.	This time she was determined to mean it .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	In L.A. these places would have been broken into about thirty seconds after the owner closed for the day .
te	NP_VP_.	He raised an eyebrow as the door opened .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment I lay in paralysed shock , my gaping eyes fixed on the empty air where the demon had disintegrated .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Kenji says , eyes flashing with a kind of hatred I 've never seen in him before .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	From the hallway they climbed a long marble staircase with red carpet into what Jacy realized was the main foyer of the White House .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But mostly it 's furniture .
te	NP_VP_.	Half a dozen or so footballers followed suit and the rest of us realised the show was over .
te	NP_PP_.	Thought about the tree and the words .
te	SBAR_VP_.	How much she would do , never to let that happen again .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	With a groan she sat up .
te	S_NP_VP_.	The skin underneath is badly burned , bubbling , and seeping with blood and a yellow liquid I try not to dwell on .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was that meant to be some sort of apology ?
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So I wasn 't immune to a cute boy with a sappy expression .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did these men explain their motive ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe there was a hockey game ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now he couldn 't quite slow his embarrassingly rapid pace as he covered the distance between the library and the dining room .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then his gaze dropped to her chest .
te	S_VP_.	Sounds and smells washed over her like lapping waves , sometimes intensely , at other times muted .
te	S_CC_S_.	Steve 's lashes dropped and she could feel the torment of the battle that raged in his troubled mind .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How are we going to get them open ?
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The foliage above has grown right across in parts .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	During the day I stay indoors , watching television , reading , playing games , making model aeroplanes .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Only Biff and Todd remained .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But I can 't .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What drink could she ask for that already existed in that time ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And also he 's an artist .
te	NP_VP_.	The restlessness had begun long before he 'd gotten injured on assignment .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	This time I understood that she meant hot .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	For the first time in a long time it made me rethink going to the cookout with her .
te	S_CC_S_.	She 'd had a good day and her spirits were as bright as the afternoon sun .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	15 We ended up eating dinner at the cafeteria .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did it stick for them ?
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And you 'd be with her .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the junior communications associate know more than he was letting on ?
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he swept her away to their quarters as she protested and sobbed .
te	S_VP_.	Sitting at home was too boring .
te	SBAR_VP_.	Until she 'd found out about Seguin .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	This time the shock put all the lights out .
te	NP_PP_.	The eyes of a predator .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had she got herself turned around like that ?
te	WHNP_SQ_.	Who knows what 's going through that crazy girl 's head ?
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I only wanted to chat with him .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When Sophie saw her puffed eyelids and red eyes in the mirror she started sobbing again .
te	S_CC_S_.	He wasn 't immune to the pain in her pretty green eyes but he shook his head mercilessly .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That it has to involve you .
te	S_VP_.	Put it away for now , go watch the telly or something .
te	S_CC_S_.	I 'm about to ruin everything but I can 't stop it .
te	S_CC_S_.	Her thoughts died an abrupt death and she jerked in surprise as he suddenly slapped her wet behind .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	When do you think you will be coming home ?
te	NP_PP_.	No point in being rude .
te	NP_PP_.	A girl with Delilah 's fiery red hair .
te	S_CC_S_.	Marcus and Robin were still arguing and Rhea had to step in .
te	S_CC_S_.	She felt it claw at her cheek and she screamed and pulled her arms towards it , almost strangling herself .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I remembered what she had done to me and that grief dissolved .
te	NP_VP_.	There were a lot of things I wanted to do with it that I had not been able to do because of the time pressure .
te	S_CC_S_.	Derek 's cell phone rang and he answered .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did they find out his parents had been rogue ?
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Usually he had to be knocked out and chained .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he tested the weight on his feet and did a small calculation which revealed that two people had been subtracted from his back .
te	S_VP_.	Knowing she would have at least one more chance to qualify before she was kicked out of basic helped her to relax , somewhat .
te	OTHER	The sooner the night was forgotten the better .
te	S_CC_S_.	I recommend lashing yourself down or you 'll fly out of the shower .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So the local police aren 't going to be able to find anything dirty on him .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she want the affair to continue ?
te	S_CC_S_.	Their grandfather 's fingers formed a hollow circle and he plunged them into the crack of the door .
te	S_NP_VP_.	I look around at the people ´ s faces .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	Out of the corner of his eye he could see Haworth standing partly in the shadow to his left .
te	S_CC_S_.	He paced and the air turned desperately cold .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So this was their infamous leader Nick had mentioned .
te	NP_VP_.	We were once part of our own small army .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I instantly understood what all the fuss was about .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What he wasn 't prepared for was all the people backstage .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps that 's why we have bonded so much in this short time .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	In a partial wall a brick fireplace stands alone , charred and abandoned .
te	SBAR_VP_.	To Eleanor 's credit she did try to make a hasty exit .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What I was trying to say was , why don 't the two of you join us to have lunch at another place ?
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What made you come here to show me that ?
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And those places are all welfare basket cases .
te	S_VP_.	Running toward danger is foolhardy .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We usually reserve that side for the least of us .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	"Today his eye patch has a big blue "" X "" stitched over it ."
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If we were only six levels underground maybe there was a way to get out .
te	SBAR_VP_.	As you know their family line has a star that shines on them and through them .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What time is it ?
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I gently disengaged him and handed the dog to Shannon .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But I can 't prove that .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	For a moment she faltered .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Dryden clearly still saw her as a viable target and too many people close to him had already been hurt .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Mom hope that by getting pregnant with me , she 'd snag the guy who knocked her up ?
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there 's just a mess of veins and nerves and meat and flesh .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Beck really wanted to get the boy out of the way for a while .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But this wasn 't their sun .
te	S_CC_S_.	She nodded and the entire family broke into cheers .
te	SBAR_VP_.	As the swell pushed inward a great wall of spray gushed forth and enveloped the large boulder .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where the hell was she ?
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now he was launching a counterattack .
te	SBAR_VP_.	As if he could feel nothing but her body .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Mostly it is the diplomats or politicians doing all of the traveling to other countries .
te	NP_PP_.	Another glance at the door .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So he had to keep this contained and low-key , ensuring his plans for the international satellite summit went smoothly this week .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I crumpled up the leaf , breathing out in frustration .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That I didn 't know .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then he said , "" Give her something to make her sick ."
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do you think that Poseidon got there so quickly ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	If anyone would bother with what was happening around them .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I allowed out at this time of night ?
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Either way we have a duty of care to those girls .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But there is such thing as the snake Sanguine .
te	NP_VP_.	Vin remained in her crouch , waiting for the men to attack first , her posture threatening despite the frilly dress .
te	NP_PP_.	A blind human soldier for his assassin ?
te	VP_.	Mostly about drinking water .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I remembered how upset she 'd been when I 'd taken my home-baked cookies out of my backpack at lunch the previous Friday .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Hearing it from someone he could spend the rest of his life with and die happy .
te	NP_VP_.	They rode on horses , carriages and wagons moving on the rocky street .
te	OTHER	Something intensely meaningful that would show some recognition that she 'd hurt me .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What would I do without you ?
te	S_CC_S_.	The weather had become dry here and the heavens above were as dark as nothingness .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So it became my job to do what I could to find out more .
te	OTHER	But why should Nick believe Grand ?
te	WHNP_SQ_.	Who would ever believe it anyway ?
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When he entered he saw a woman sitting at a table .
te	S_VP_.	Standing in front of me was a police officer .
te	S_CC_S_.	Confusion swept over me as I looked myself over and I was in my black negligee .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why is this humorous to you ?
te	OTHER	Could she be used to some advantage ?
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe things can change .
te	NP_VP_.	Moments ticked by like spiders scuttling up my spine .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it was her caring nature he found charming .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So much that grew in this harsh , alkaline environment had evolved some nasty defenses : long thorns , hooked barbs , sharp branches .
te	NP_PP_.	Any more claim than Rawlings ?
te	VP_.	- when I entered the auditorium .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But Madeline had the most interesting reaction .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why read the poets when the precepts of the Gospel should be pondered ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	Unless you ' ve already joined .
te	S_CC_S_.	Her head was arched back and his pants were around his ankles .
te	NP_VP_.	I 'm amazed and appalled .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could Josie ever know ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	As she hoped her movement threw him off balance .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But perhaps that distraction was enough for Misha .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What he felt was felt without the hope of commendation .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	From the day they 'd met he 'd been able to sense her moods with uncanny accuracy .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She often sounded like a friendly enemy , a religious woman who always goes to church but often ended up as a rude Witch inside their class .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now you have to tell me what I want to know .
te	NP_PP_.	None of that mattered , though .
te	VP_.	Take it from someone who knows .
te	S_VP_.	Coming up empty one more time .
te	S_NP_VP_.	The mirror behind the bar was lined with shelves , all filled with every bottle of liquor you could imagine .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She just didn 't want them to be older and more responsible right now .
te	NP_VP_.	Cross covered the ground to the side alley surprisingly quickly despite appearing to only saunter along .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Today I 'm just trying to see if I can finish one more .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What pained me so much to hear was how he was screaming .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could she feel her usual passion for a man she was virtually nursing , as she had been that day ?
te	OTHER	- How old were you when you set the course ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But instead his eyes are swollen and red from crying .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the first voice spoke again .
te	S_VP_.	Smiling I took the paperwork .
te	S_NP_VP_.	His appreciative groan rumbled through her at the same time his cell phone rang .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did Jeremy find anything ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	"' Ours is not to question why -- ' "" She let her voice trail off ."
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If for no other purpose , I had to make sure she was safe .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I weaved my fingers through his .
te	S_NP_VP_.	* * * Haven peeled her eyes open and glanced at the clock , surprised to see it read noon .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then he 's on to girl fifty-three .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But choking on dust as the air gradually thinned ?
te	NP_NP_VP_.	The reason he 'd moved heaven and earth to get her off the case .
te	SBAR_VP_.	Even if it did mean her own death .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	For some reason they were much less interested in him now .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So she got her private investigator 's license , got herself an office and placed some ads in newspapers and magazines .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So they began uploading all their storage into subspace .
te	S_NP_VP_.	I struggle for words she 'll understand .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	How the miner managed I did not know , but it was a beautiful release the moment our gills opened to capture the air we needed .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Either way we need to set up for kidnapping , phone trace , surveillance .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She also was infinitely pleased that she and Beau were getting by without any help from her exceedingly wealthy family .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it enough to stall , to buy Painter time to find him ?
te	PP_NP_VP_.	After a while Maran set aside his harp , packing it back into its covering .
te	S_VP_.	Stopping the blow would not have stopped the insult .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And she loved it .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he prepared to defend himself ?
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it stirring bittersweet feelings similar to the ones churning in me ?
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Only he would know who Ixion was .
te	VP_.	Childish and had not thought about it .
te	S_CC_S_.	Guy took off like a rocket and that spider just chased after him like he was going to eat him .
te	VP_.	Jacked their security feed .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So she dialed Della .
te	S_VP_.	Looking away Amy said , ' Trying to cut down -- makes me do regrettable things .
te	S_CC_S_.	His tone was serious and she leaned on one elbow to look at him .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What had been hidden in the shadows of his darkened room was now illuminated by the hallway 's flickering lantern .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know my birth parents also died in an automobile accident ?
te	WHNP_SQ_.	Which one was the real Iris ?
te	VP_.	Don 't bother with the race .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she doing in the same room as him ?
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why rely on one to get the job done when four could serve him better ?
te	OTHER	I 'm working until close and then I 'm taking one of the guys out for dinner after .
te	SBAR_VP_.	As he walked in an orange cat arrogantly walked past them and out the gate .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What was my purpose if it wasn 't to be a great actress , if it wasn 't to have children ?
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the phone just go dead ?
te	NP_PP_.	Nothing of my mother .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Whatever you feel like eating .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did this late-night summons mean she 'd told Clay about the two of them ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	Dressed all in black , hoods pulled over their heads and wearing dark gloves they completed their tasks .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	In fact blood red was the only color on his wagon at all , sprayed haphazardly around the doorway and windows .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then something scraped , slid toward me on the floor .
te	NP_PP_.	Your strength against mine ?
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I looked back at Stubbs .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But Stephen had deliberately skipped their meeting last night , something that had illustrated his disregard for her as both a person and an employee .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	Who 'd have thought leather could become that hot without melting ?
te	S_VP_.	A little shorter than she would become full grown .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So it was rumoured .
te	S_NP_VP_.	He was so terrified of being caught out he could barely speak these days .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Charlotte just couldn 't be sure .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But somehow I kept it together , breathing in and out without feeling the vomit rise in my throat .
te	OTHER	But it might and I could see that admission in his eyes .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	In and out he moved , in and out he savored her .
te	SBAR_VP_.	Not when she focused her vision to see those scuffed up and battered boots a foot away .
te	VP_.	Had been laughing at her ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	My Aunt Letty tells me I was born old and tells me she 's proud of me .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Roberto only answered the necessary questions and did not offer any further details .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	The way she smiles at the simplest of things , or the way she crinkles her nose when she doesn 't like something .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So they wonder , as mankind did in the past , what to expect .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he caught sight of a lone sheet in the middle of the room where she had been lying just before he came in .
te	OTHER	Do you have any idea what my mother has pulled ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But already I can feel myself trembling , the rough tone of his words only serving to inflame me more .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He then invites the other contestants onto the stage .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But it isn 't .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	Inside the museum he was greeted by its familiar warmth and smell .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So much black cut by random slashes of red that looked like open wounds on the dark skin of the canvas .
te	NP_PP_.	Lots of nasty , biting insects .
te	S_NP_VP_.	She barely heard them , and afterward wasn 't entirely sure she had .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he seemed to control his features and smiled the lopsided grin that tightened round her heart like a fist .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He never called , never wrote , nothing .
te	S_VP_.	Go to his parents , tell them a bunch of creepy invisible faeries were out to get their son ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	I thank Logan for coming and tell him we 'll stop and see him when we visit Bentley and Zeke .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	This morning I feel like I could be so fortunate .
te	S_VP_.	Introducing her as the new director of the clinic would be part of a report .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And there we have it .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then I realized that she possessed a fierce amount of determination , and would certainly attend whether or not I wanted her to .
te	NP_VP_.	Let 's figure out what she wants .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She just didn 't want to do it because she had dinner reservations that night .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you ever think of that , Julia ?
te	S_CC_S_.	Darius nodded his head and we started the long walk down the tunnel .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But it 's okay , Lexi .
te	OTHER	Had I stopped impressing him ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	Choosing someone they wouldn 't mind seeing fall .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	For the price could be no other .
te	NP_VP_.	I 'm really looking forward to the Passing Ceremony in a few hours and don 't want it to be cut short .
te	S_NP_VP_.	He had his mind set on a course of action and nothing she said was going to shift him from it .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What was a matter with her ?
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She actually blushed because her mind pictured her mysterious stranger and herself wrapped in each other 's arms , gloriously naked and enjoying the same activities .
te	S_CC_S_.	It was an elegant home and Lisa had every right to be proud of it .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What have we done ?
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So her shiver had been more than just nerves .
te	S_CC_S_.	She then stepped daintily out of her panties and Jonas gritted his teeth .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was he flying out there to be thrown to the wolves ?
te	PP_NP_VP_.	After tea she bathed and dressed in khaki shorts and a white polo shirt selected from the clothes Elisabeth had sent to her room .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he blinked fast , as if holding back tears of his own .
te	VP_.	""" What about you two ?"
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did the runes give them superhuman strength ?
te	S_CC_S_.	The blades whirled and Sherry held it up to face her .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	As my foot hits the bottom step I become aware of voices talking in the kitchen .
te	SBAR_VP_.	If it really was Gladys .
te	S_NP_VP_.	The Dirty Duck bar had a 24-hour licence , and served alcohol to the many travellers from the moment they disembarked from Portsmouth .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then everything went black .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Reluctantly she picked up her phone .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Every year you spend a fortune on that stuff .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Not when they realized what I had in mind .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Didn 't like men ?
te	OTHER	Definitely not team sports .
te	S_CC_S_.	My arms went tight around him and I pressed the side of my face to his chest .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But people with guns could be there .
te	NP_VP_.	Several minutes passed without sound or movement from him .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course I would stay with him .
te	S_NP_VP_.	She made quick work of it and was indeed very glad it was finally over .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	How else could Chase fix things ?
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had they met ?
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I hear it .
te	S_NP_VP_.	I recounted it all and about the last remark she made to me , when I was leaving .
te	OTHER	Then he put it down and his eyes were watering .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She then walks straight back to the up left corner .
te	SBAR_VP_.	Although I supposed I had to get used to that idea if we were going to be friends .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	After I 'd been flying for about half an hour I spotted a clearing .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she already losing her appetite for human food ?
te	NP_PP_.	Lots of leather couches , chairs , tables and bookcase after bookcase .
te	S_VP_.	Sometimes showing people the right way to behave was enough to embarrass them into behaving right .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We all live in the collectivity of society , be it the social collectivity , the economic or political collectivity .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	The minute I say that though my mind drifts back to Trevor .
te	NP_PP_.	That depth of hate ?
te	NP_PP_.	The adobe wall between them .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was it to be savored as something special or feared as an extension of her father 's legacy ?
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then the phone erupted and startled him .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	"Then a phone played the first notes of "" The Yellow Rose of Texas "" and broke the spell ."
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Finally Liza couldn 't stand it anymore , especially since she was moving as fast as she could .
te	S_VP_.	Going up against them with her bare hands didn 't seem like the smartest thing to do .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you ever see the movie Ground Hog Day ?
te	VP_.	To prove to him that you don 't want his money .
te	OTHER	Or show him any emotion at all other than anger .
te	OTHER	At this point I really didn 't care .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	When we open our minds to God 's view of the universe and all that lies within it , what changes for us ?
te	NP_PP_.	> Waste of meat .
te	S_CC_S_.	I don 't know what 's wrong with her and it makes my chest ache .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But Ella complicated things and he tried damn hard not to do complicated .
te	NP_VP_.	The crowd seemed more relaxed the more he played with the band .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I argue against that craving in him , that bottomless need for something more ?
te	S_VP_.	Telling Hutch about Clark 's most recent attempt to get her to take him back would only upset him .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because if you can 't come back for Christmas I should have put the tree up so at least you could have seen it .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But she was more familiar with the layout of the house than anyone else .
te	S_NP_VP_.	She pulled her knees to her chest the way Aspen sat sometimes .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he pulled back far enough to gaze upon her face .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That I 'm upset .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Where had it come from ?
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	Hollis probably did want to keep his job badly enough for that .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They always have wings .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Not what I said after your dropped your bomb .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she lifted her drink in an amusing salute to Julia .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	With my luck she 'll be sealed and healed by morning .
te	OTHER	But when he turned his eyes southward he stiffened and caught his breath .
te	OTHER	She turned her head towards him , eyes squinted , and brows furrowed together .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What we should have done was test the gift first .
te	S_VP_.	Tell you what , bud , why don 't you try to get some rest tonight .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe he wasn 't .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I see this great red dragon trying to keep the sea away from the wall .
te	NP_PP_.	The pocket of the purple dress .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could he fix it ?
te	S_CC_S_.	Sean 's hands slip around my waist and he slams my body into his hips .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So she resolved herself .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	They all laughed as they made their way out to the open field by the barn .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she opened the box of sugar lumps .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then he saw where she had stopped , and realized he had no right to be here for this .
te	S_CC_S_.	I was the second to last to be appraised and it was agonizing waiting for them to get to me .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he murder James ?
te	PP_NP_VP_.	As a guest of the Atkins family he 'd been given a complimentary guest membership and was being courted to join the club permanently .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So Tres became Snowball .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	In the sky a dead crane drifted .
te	S_VP_.	Catching me had really made his day .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When we get home you will be put under arrest and kept by the witches .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	At home I 'd never had friends either .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	A woman he knew he could never touch in the real flesh .
te	OTHER	Was she making the biggest mistake of her life ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then they were both exploding together , Destiny safe in his arms , soaring together , shattering , free-falling through time and space .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	This time it was she , not Marcus , who spoke the words he had said to her at the Lyric .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Not until they had killed the escapees .
te	S_NP_VP_.	I can tell you it was a shock to move to such a big city .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	People really didn 't know how to give good stuff .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That it was a necessary evil .
te	NP_VP_.	Rob smiles and holds out his hand .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps she hadn 't been able to bear to look at them .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she wrong to be angry ?
te	S_CC_S_.	When he got back home he asked his mum if there had been any calls but there hadn 't been .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But even that refuge could not last much longer under such a barrage .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why would he let her have a phone now ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But as soon as he heard Jeremy 's voice he sprung to his feet and rushed up to the kennel door and barked a happy bark .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But the other stuff stuck .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps I grow tired .
te	S_CC_S_.	The smile fell from my face and I just felt kind of stupid .
te	S_NP_VP_.	His hand moved downwards , his palm feeling that adorable derriere that had been so alluring the first time he 'd seen her .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why did I have to make this choice between my life and a baby 's life ?
te	S_CC_S_.	Maya came across one and that 's why she was kidnapped and questioned by them !
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he sleep last night ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	Unless Torin and Andris had used magic to open it .
te	S_CC_S_.	This was a serious situation and Angie was scared .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I be so self-absorbed to obsess about being in his bed when his mom is here , paralyzed ?
te	NP_VP_.	An affair with this girl is tantamount to abandoning your duties .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And maybe it did .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I realize as we turn the corner that they have three cars not only one .
te	SBAR_VP_.	That we got to spend any time alone at all was something I should appreciate instead of whining to myself about waking up alone .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Last night she almost killed one of her closest friends .
te	NP_VP_.	You must learn these things if you wish to stay here .
te	VP_.	Let alone a video during that intimate activity like that .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Last time he said that he admitted to killing someone , albeit by accident .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So all this gimmickry , this Sgt. Pepper 's stuff that everybody has to do now , it 's going the other direction , isn 't it ?
te	WHNP_SQ_.	How much cruel could he get ?
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So I let him leave .
te	VP_.	Killing a ghost that scared Toby ; no biggie .
te	NP_PP_.	Their sudden respect for you .
te	NP_PP_.	Even the little pot of baking soda .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe there 's nothing to suspect .
te	S_CC_S_.	Stefan and I exchanged a glance and he unlocked the door , letting me in to turn on the lights as he retrieved the package .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What good would that do ?
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He 's already said he 's on thin ice .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I instantly felt guilty for letting my relationship with Lisa and Ruby dissolve .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then everything would go great again for another two weeks as everyone silently waited for the time bomb to go off again .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why do you have it out for Shannon ?
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So this is what they do it for - the rush , the adrenaline that 's sparking in my veins .
te	OTHER	As bizarre as it was , why would she ?
te	S_VP_.	was all I could think to ask .
te	NP_VP_.	No thud of the bullet hitting him or penetrating his skin .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I just want it all to go away .
te	S_VP_.	Dealing with men like this on a daily basis was far more headache than it was worth .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	In less than a week they 'd be playing stadiums and concert halls .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And only one woman had ever said his name the way Sunshine did just now .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Half the night she 'd had to resist the urge to throw her arms around her stepdaughter and comfort her .
te	NP_PP_.	All week away from home .
te	NP_VP_.	Wolves are shy creatures .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What had she said ?
te	S_CC_S_.	I told you but you never believed me .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Even if a wife was being abused by her husband , unless she pressed charges there was nothing the police could do .
te	NP_VP_.	There used to be some very dangerous parts in this country .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she came right out with it .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	During the day he remained hidden under boughs of trees and bushes .
te	S_VP_.	Feeling crummy and old was better than feeling crummy and alone any day .
te	NP_VP_.	I shook my head and picked up the phone .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So I walked to this bridge and began to cross it .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then you would always be popping up in our lives .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then I glared at him .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can we be ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Yet somehow he managed to support us both while turning me so I could find the right keys on the keypad .
te	VP_.	Especially from his family .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Approaching the toilet with trepidation fearing urinal infection she braced herself but experienced no extra discomfort whilst sitting with her head below her knees .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did something happen at the Visitors Center last evening ?
te	NP_PP_.	No fun at all .
te	OTHER	Not to mention trying to keep his face straight at her dramatic tirade .
te	S_CC_S_.	I swung my feet against the bed and my father smiled .
te	S_NP_VP_.	I scan the room for Michelle , her awkward haircut , that dim rose of hopelessness she wears around her neck .
te	NP_VP_.	The crowd seemed to sense that something spectacular was on the way .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least the rain had stopped .
te	S_VP_.	Finding out more about him was added incentive to dig deep into the history of the old home .
te	S_CC_S_.	He was fully hard and I wasted no time moving back on top of him , pulling my panties off just before straddling him again .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Mostly they try it on everyone .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Because of this he had to use his imagination and VHS copies Star Wars to keep himself entertained .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I was getting the cold shoulder .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But it 'll only take a few hours .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Tying your hair back in French knots , keeping your every statement clinical and detached .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How was she going to get to the bottom of this from New Jersey ?
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he hadn 't arrived yet ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	She had always admired him from a distance the way he nurtured plants and cared for his shop .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you draw him ?
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What was she doing ?
te	NP_NP_VP_.	This time he sipped the drink in his hand .
te	NP_VP_.	Javan was instantly entranced by her presence .
te	OTHER	Would I stay to finish my art degree ?
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	We still didn 't even know what my sister was doing .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his mouth followed the curve of her cheek to the corner of her smile .
te	OTHER	Should you stay true to your friends , whatever the consequences ?
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But that was more information than she needed .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was I prepared and able to meet the consequences of this accident , costly and high-priced they were ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	With a ruby rose and emerald leaves resting on the hilt of a golden sword .
te	S_CC_S_.	This moment might be a turning point in my life and calories were not an issue .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	This time you moved yourself , but not all the way .
te	NP_VP_.	Zeke turned to me and barked .
te	OTHER	And where is your family ?
te	S_VP_.	Appeared as a minor character in two school plays .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He usually sits over there at that booth by the front , unless we 've kicked him out .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So that 's what we did .
te	S_VP_.	Don 't think anything has stopped us from moving forward just because we have you .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly there was another voice .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So I spent my time setting up a trap in the clearing where Charlie had died .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he sneezed and went back to his spot in the corner .
te	VP_.	To be on the outside looking in .
te	SBAR_VP_.	If he wasn 't such a boring idiot .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He only prayed that what he 'd done to her would work .
te	VP_.	Deciding eventually that some form of trickery must be at work .
te	NP_VP_.	That hope was dashed when she went back to work after Christmas .
te	VP_.	Am I not fair ?
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But it had to be now .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now she might never even see daylight again .
te	NP_VP_.	It had been two weeks since I had seen her last , when she had made a surprise visit to Australia .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it was over .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The girl slowly opened her eyes , getting a grasp of where she was .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	All of a sudden I very badly didn 't want to be in it .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she ran away into the bedroom , crying .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then he nodded .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	Who would she be without hers ?
te	VP_.	Please , wait , inside the control room .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then we 'll have to press through them until we find one close enough to see the city .
te	S_CC_S_.	Soul hunched her shoulders and Hiro looked away with an actual blush on his face .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So he flipped a coin , thinking of Lucy 's ' leave it up to fate ' philosophy .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Surely he would have noticed the rich pink tinge of the sky , the beautiful half-circle of reflected light high above .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What had started out as an argument had eventually progressed to a physical exchange .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he let go .
te	NP_PP_.	A titanic clash between two powerful forces .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	Who would have a snowmobile in Oklahoma ?
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had I behaved in that manner ?
te	S_CC_S_.	Since Jayne 's moved out it 's just been me and Alan living separate lives paying our own way .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now they are on foot .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he wish to make her hate him ?
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe we could go out .
te	NP_VP_.	I opened my eyes again , the fire inside me compressed into a single burning need .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then she sought the character meaning B in Thai and got three answers .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he made himself go back to the party and made a vain pretense of enjoying the day .
te	S_VP_.	So stop by and say hi - don 't be shy !
te	SBAR_VP_.	"If not , then ... "" "" Then I lose , in several ways ."
te	S_VP_.	Couldn 't let either of them get hurt .
te	S_NP_VP_.	She took special care to project a bored appearance and only offered a weak smile each time her father glanced in her direction .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What would my life have been like if I had remained with her as a child ?
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are you afraid ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe it was the way her head fit so naturally against his collarbone .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I also didn 't want to be anything like them .
te	NP_VP_.	He focused on the drunken girls trying to place their orders .
te	NP_PP_.	A dazzle of inspiration .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	For a moment everything seemed unfamiliar .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But then normality with a vampire was asking a lot .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What was left of their bed mattress covered the broken pieces of the bed frame in the middle of the room .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he think I would run back into his arms , and we would start where we left off ?
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	It still makes me cringe , even for the ninth time .
te	NP_PP_.	A stupid , plastic ring with sparkles .
te	OTHER	Chapter Forty-three I rose from the bed , opened my suitcase , and went into the bathroom to change into my nightgown and brush my teeth .
te	SBAR_VP_.	Except that was nothing like as intense as what they were witnessing now .
te	NP_VP_.	Some gauze would 've been nice .
te	NP_PP_.	Another wave of pain .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Now I love all those things and more .
te	S_NP_VP_.	We were turning around , headed back to the U.S. I checked my monitor before me .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why shouldn 't she enjoy a cup of coffee with a man ?
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she not lose her only son in the war ?
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That I love him .
te	VP_.	Don 't try to slide out of this .
te	OTHER	But could anyone really blame me for thinking like that ?
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Next time it will be a riot .
te	S_CC_S_.	He watched her jaw clench again and he heard her teeth grind together .
te	S_CC_S_.	I knock his DVD stand over and all the DVDs fall to the floor .
te	NP_PP_.	Deal with it , big boy .
te	S_VP_.	Dating her had been a wild ride , full of the unexpected .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Right now he was doing everything himself and I could see he was growing weary .
te	NP_VP_.	A wave of nostalgia hit me as we arrived outside our charming home .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Right across his shoulders were medium sized horizontal wings .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Suddenly I felt furious .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But he wanted me to speak with you .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was she out there now , even as we faced the horrors of this modified existence , hungry , hungry , starving ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	How you trapped her in her own restaurant and then burned it down around her .
te	NP_PP_.	A life without pudding !
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So he stepped up to the first one and pushed open the wooden door .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	Beyond their small dining room table he could see tufts of white fiber floating in the air .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What was this man planning to do with her ?
te	NP_NP_VP_.	The gray mornings he hadn 't had the will to rise out of his sleeping bag and walk on .
te	S_VP_.	Seeing these two kiss really made me jealous .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did I even sleep at all ?
te	S_VP_.	Blocking them out had become almost impossible .
te	S_CC_S_.	The flesh was flayed open and the wound was at least an inch deep .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Were they seriously asking me those questions ?
te	S_VP_.	Sleeping with Damien Vane , the real one , wasn 't supposed to be part of her plan tonight .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	How come we didn 't figure it out ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	I could only hope he wouldn 't jump to the likely conclusion he 'd ended up in hell given the present company .
te	NP_PP_.	Huge thanks to Katrina for being the one to read it first .
te	OTHER	Like maybe a Hummer or a Winnebago .
te	VP_.	said the Senior Wrangler .
te	NP_PP_.	All that goo on the ground , that was pieces of him .
te	VP_.	Not a lump , but a clot that found its way there from somewhere else , something that doesn 't belong there .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That way we aren 't showing all our cards at once .
te	SBAR_VP_.	When I finally stepped outside it felt like walking into a different world .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why had he had to go today ?
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When I 'd parked at the trail head there had been two trucks tucked along the roadside .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did he really think she 'd fall for this again ?
te	S_VP_.	Pulling the trigger unleashed a cloud of pellets .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now it didn 't appear as if either of those things was going to happen .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then there were his eyes .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Surely Mal or Trinity had heard something and would be here any minute Camden figured , right ?
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he turned and disappeared into the crowd .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you change your mind ?
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What are you saying ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe he could call it out before me because he could read me that well .
te	S_VP_.	reading portents into every little thing , looking for symbols and meaning every time a rabbit runs across your path or a horse lets wind .
te	S_VP_.	Pleasing the crowd has become irrelevant .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	At least she wouldn 't need to buy a uniform ; something she was thankful for , since they still weren 't regulation in most French schools .
te	VP_.	Didn 't want to .
te	NP_VP_.	The weight of their stares fell on her .
te	OTHER	Even just be there to listen .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	Plus I had part of the man 's soul .
te	NP_VP_.	Brooke cupped Emily 's face in her hands .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then his look turned sour .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Inch by inch I took him into my mouth until I felt him hit the back of my throat .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	All those years I 've been looking for a way to have you again .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she think it ?
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So someone else must be home , or must have been very recently .
te	OTHER	Or just to keep his eyes occupied ?
te	NP_VP_.	Gwen was wearing a pair of faded jeans that hugged her hips and ass beautifully .
te	NP_VP_.	It was probably nothing .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	Once I 'm finished I set it back on the sink .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he rounded the corner , stepping over the stick .
te	SBAR_VP_.	If he 'd done it before he could do it again !
te	S_NP_VP_.	Scribbles gives Dr. Potts a dubious expression , and then exits the door closes to the large bay window .
te	S_VP_.	Deciding to listen to her parents had been hard .
te	SBAR_VP_.	Just as he 'd said the night before : pierce , pull , pierce .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And even that input would not be enough for him to pay off his unpaid speeding fines .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What had she seen in those men in designer suits ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	Do not forget also that One Eye is Welsh too , as are his people , and then look at the things he has done .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	For the death of whatever might have been between us .
te	NP_VP_.	Derek was silent , recognising that he wanted to say more , but that he was thinking about what he was going to say next .
te	S_CC_S_.	he asked and I blinked .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And so I did .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	All that morning they were busy with preparations .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	Who the hell was she ?
te	PP_NP_VP_.	Of course Sam was late .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And that someone wasn 't Damon .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now you 're calling Panda 's stone a Sun Stone and helping the people who jacked it from us .
te	NP_PP_.	Time for his brother to die .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	One by one they threw their weapons to the ground in front of them raising their hands to the air in surrender .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why don 't you call over to the house , see how Jeff 's men are doing , and if there is any change with Anthony .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So Sal knew who had set the blaze at the Prince .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	At this moment they were beyond both .
te	SBAR_VP_.	Although , I 'd make an exception for her if I had to .
te	VP_.	Kept us fighting , even when we should have given up .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did she know about those ?
te	NP_VP_.	He couldn 't find a lock anywhere .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How had she known ?
te	PP_NP_VP_.	On the last day of preparations Ruby sat in the crematorium , serious and vigilant .
te	OTHER	Either she was a very good actress or Samuel hadn 't confided his suspicions about Mr. Thornton to his sister .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe I 'd even stay in a nunnery or a brothel .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	CHAPTER 18 CHRISTMAS morning dawned clear and cold .
te	OTHER	Maybe I really did need a garlic necklace .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	After a few moments she regretted her thoughtless haste , and wished she had tried to follow backward the frescoes she had passed on the way in .
te	S_CC_S_.	Elan quickly manifested a black Softail of his own and we got on our way back to town .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or perhaps he 'd default to the fact she was a spoiled brat .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	The possibility they wouldn 't get out at all .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And success in the face of high risk was what could make a career .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Though it had been agonizing being without her , at least he 'd succeeded in fixing the problem he 'd caused by being too greedy for her .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Even now I 'm afraid to ask .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Did you know that I had a really hard time doing that ?
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That I don 't want to be here any longer .
te	NP_VP_.	I 'll need to run some numbers in the morning and confer with Constance about the commercial aspects of the alliance .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	When we decided it was not working for us we talked about it like adults and parted as good friends .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	The next day she was at work alone again .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But it was more than that .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Perhaps it was mine now .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	The smell of burnt tires hardly passed through his mind .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So I grabbed a rope , stuffed it under my shirt and headed off down the paddock .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe he was protecting himself .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	After being processed I sat in a cell waiting for my brother to show up to get me out .
te	S_CC_S_.	He could be dean of the J program but he loves teaching too much .
te	S_VP_.	Hearing both her amusement as well as the distant sirens told him that she really was okay .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	He slowly lifted up on his other elbow to get a look at her face , hoping it would ring a bell .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	No matter how bizarre the person .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	Today he had to escape his own thoughts .
te	OTHER	And join the club .
te	S_NP_VP_.	Says a female voice I don 't recognise .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I certainly wasn 't going to stick around with all the hostility in my room .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	For an instant her fear included him .
te	S_VP_.	Being mated sounded as if it was more a physical need rather than an emotional one .
te	NP_VP_.	His other clothes were in the basket on his bike .
te	NP_PP_.	The floor of the arena .
te	PP_NP_VP_.	Unlike the others she held the swords by the handles .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What possible interest could he have in her affairs ?
te	CC_NP_VP_.	And I bet that sign right there would tell us if either of us could decipher it .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I have left her unprotected ?
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	But now we can .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he turned and waited for his visitor .
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	I finally broke free of the bushes to find a moonlit river , maybe twenty feet wide , stretching out in front of me .
te	SBAR_VP_.	That she had crawled across the floor with a broken ankle ... to seal the ring of fire ... was still mind-blowing to me .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How did they know his name ?
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How could I have been so childish , naïve , irrational to believe even a single part of this nonsense ?
te	NP_PP_.	Good luck on your hunt .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So it 's really over .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That night set everything into motion .
te	S_VP_.	Aren 't there any agents of the law commissioned with discovering his whereabouts ?
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Prologue I met Amanda through a friend .
te	SBAR_VP_.	Not when she 'd trusted me with something as precious as her innocence .
te	VBD_NP_VP_.	Was that the reason he 'd started dating Elodie ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	I tried to tell myself he 'd just stolen it .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Then he rose from the table .
te	SBAR_VP_.	What was so ironic was that she and Ryan could both get wanted they wanted if only he told her that he loved her .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How do we fix everything ?
te	S_VP_.	Making love to Colt was always so intense .
te	RB_NP_VP_.	Only Paul was seven and wearing a toque , mittens and a snowsuit two sizes too big for him .
te	OTHER	And not in a good way either .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	Or maybe she volunteered to help .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And yet you 've brought her to meet me when you haven 't let me meet your other girlfriends .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If Josh was aware of Claire 's critical scrutiny he didn 't show it .
te	SBAR_VP_.	As yours has done .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	"Each time I broach it , even with local groups that purport to support environmental concerns , I get the cold shoulder "" ."
te	NP_PP_.	Buffalo River Fishing Camp for Sale .
te	NP_VP_.	The fact that he knew she was deliberately flirting with the Traitor did not lessen his embarrassment .
te	SBAR_NP_VP_.	If you guys hadn 't played up the theatrics maybe I 'd have had a chance .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Finally he threw back his head and released a shout that sounded like a war cry .
te	S_NP_VP_.	To have access to medical technology that would never reach this far .
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	How can we understand anything ?
te	NP_ADVP_VP_.	She fully intended to trot Dan most of the way home to cut her time .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Sadness I wasn 't prepared for brings tears to my eyes .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And now Jenna knew why .
te	CC_NP_VP_.	But Jason 's grip on the back of her neck stayed her impulse .
te	OTHER	Is it legal now ?
te	S_NP_VP_.	She tugged it tight and jogged over to the rope she 'd thrown down from the bridge .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What do you know about Josiah Horne ?
te	NP_PP_.	An alchemist of the highest order .
te	OTHER	Do you understand me ?
te	WHNP_SQ_.	By the Order , what 's wrong with you today ?
te	WHADVP_SQ_.	Why are you doing this ?
te	SBAR_VP_.	Not when her senses were filled with the erotic pleasure of Hunter feeding at her neck .
te	S_VP_.	Watching and feeling were two sensations she never wanted to stop .
te	S_VP_.	To clarify what just happened .
te	ADVP_NP_VP_.	Maybe the alligator hadn 't been the best part , after all .
te	WHNP_SQ_.	What 's the status ?
te	NP_NP_VP_.	That she isn 't my heart , my soul , my future ?
te	VP_.	Thank you for your support .
te	CC_ADVP_NP_VP_.	And then it struck me .
te	S_VP_.	Especially considering she wasn 't anyone harboring dangerous secrets .
te	S_VP_.	Keeping Bryce and Elle safe was almost a 24-hour job .
te	VP_.	Quench the drama , sweetheart .
te	NP_PP_.	No time for breakfast .
te	NP_NP_VP_.	A few minutes later June finished up her food and gave me a half smile and wave to match as she walked out of the restaurant .
te	S_VP_.	Having this friendship meant so much to me .
te	S_CC_S_.	I wonder if he 's gone into shock and I should repeat it .
te	IN_NP_VP_.	So much blood soaked the pavement .
